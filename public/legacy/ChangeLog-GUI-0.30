2007-11-16 06:13  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Several small bugs and display deficiencies fixed in the
	  Component tab.

2007-11-16 06:00  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  The number of decimal places from DPERDT changed from 5 to 10;
	  for ECC from 4 to 5.

2007-11-16 05:57  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  PSEPE and SSEPE renamed to Prim. Proximity and Sec. Proximity.
	  Not ideal, I know, but PSEPE and SSEPE was too cryptic.

2007-11-16 05:30  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_load_spots.glade,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  A very nasty bug discovered in NMS front-end: the accuracy and
	  maximum number of steps were swapped in a function call, causing
	  any NMS minimization to fail. Fixed. Wheew...

2007-11-16 00:42  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Printing the caorrelation matrix done, to some extent.

2007-11-16 00:10  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Connected the correlation matrix widnow to its button in the main
	  window and added some non-working code to print the matrix in it.

2007-11-15 23:45  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Aliasing of synthetic data now works.

2007-11-15 23:36  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Same thing, just for RVs.

2007-11-15 23:34  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Segfaults on plot-to-files fixed.

2007-11-15 23:28  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Residuals now work for RVs, and for saving LCs and RVs.

2007-11-15 22:59  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.h:
	  
	  Added plotting to the ASCII file functionality. WARNING: trying
	  to plot to some file without the write permissions make phoebe to
	  segfault. This still needs to be fixed!

2007-11-15 22:43  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  The middle treeview in the fitting tab is now showing all the
	  curves with their chi2s and point counts.

2007-11-15 22:15  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/Makefile.in, glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Residuals implemented for LC curves.

2007-11-15 20:28  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Removed offset and zoom combo boxes from the plotting tabs.

2007-11-15 20:00  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe_cormat.glade:
	  
	  Added the actual correlation matrix window :)

2007-11-15 19:59  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/Makefile.am, glade/phoebe.glade,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  A little window to accomodate the correlation matrix is in place;
	  the matrix itself is yet to be printed in it.

2007-11-15 19:45  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  All plotting images now gets cleared up at startup so the
	  annoying icons are now gone.

2007-11-15 19:09  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Fixed (somewhat) the problems with the time axis. The synthetic
	  curve should now scale with the observational one.

2007-11-15 17:53  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe_ld_interpolator.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  The LD dialog should be completly functional now. Please, test.

2007-11-15 17:17  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Changed the plot to file button in the star shape tab to the
	  clear button.

2007-11-15 17:10  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe_ld_interpolator.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  The LD coefficients dialog now properly displays the curve names
	  and the limb darkening laws. However, the interpolation and
	  updating aren't yet 100% functional.

2007-11-15 17:01  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Forgot to remove some printf statements in the last commit...

2007-11-15 16:59  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Fixed the bug that was preventing up and down movement on the RV
	  plots.

2007-11-15 13:47  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Changed all the printf calls in phoebe_gui_types.c to
	  phoebe_debug() calls. The terminal is a bit cleaner now.

2007-11-15 13:40  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Removed the unnecessary stuff that was added in the previous
	  commit. Sorry about this one.

2007-11-15 09:19  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Adding LC or RV without supplying a filename now doesn't really
	  do nothing, it just exits the dialog. This is ofcourse not the
	  best solution, but it prevents someone to plot an empty data.

2007-11-15 09:02  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Potential calculator now reads the values of the parameters RM,
	  F1 and F2 from the main window.

2007-11-15 08:38  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe_about.glade, glade/phoebe_load_rv.glade:
	  
	  Fixed some minor inconsistencies in the About and Load RV
	  dialogs.

2007-11-14 21:29  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.h:
	  
	  Added all the callbacks to the plotting controls and zoom
	  buttons. RV parts somehow still doesn't work properly. Will fix
	  that soon :)

2007-11-14 10:28  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Removed the "Get LD Coefficients" button from the LD tab and
	  connected the LD dialog call to "Van Hamme" button.

2007-11-13 17:09  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Plotting observed data from invalid or null files is now caught
	  and does not cause segfaults anymore.

2007-11-13 12:33  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_ld_interpolator.glade,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Connected the LD interpolation dialog to the main window by a new
	  button in the LD tab (just below the LD law and tables). The
	  interpolation seems to work, though I didn't test it with all the
	  filters; the updating is yet to be implemented. Please, try it
	  out.

2007-11-11 13:51  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.in:
	  
	  Added phoebe_ld_interpolator.glade to the makefile.

2007-11-11 13:48  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe_ld_interpolator.glade:
	  
	  Added the LD interpolation window. Still to be made operational,
	  though.

2007-11-11 12:57  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.h:
	  
	  Removed the declaration for gui_show_quit_dialog() from the
	  header.

2007-11-11 12:54  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Removed the gui_show_quit_dialog() function and replaced it with
	  gui_warning()s. Also added gui_notice()s to add and edit dialogs
	  for RVs and LCs; now the user is made aware that there is no file
	  selected in the filechoosers.
	  
	  We should consider storing the titles and messages of these and
	  future popups in a global string table, se we don't have to worry
	  about consistency.

2007-11-11 12:35  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.h:
	  
	  Created 4 kinds of message-printing functions, after the stock
	  types in GTK:
	  
	  1. gui_question(): asks the user a question and offers "Yes" and
	  "No" answers 2. gui_warning(): same as gui_question(), but with
	  the warning icon 3. gui_notice(): notifies the user about
	  something, and has only the "OK" button 4. gui_error(): same as
	  gui_notice(), but with the error icon
	  
	  All those functions take char* title and char* message arguments
	  and return 1 for "Yes" or "OK" and 0 for "No".

2007-11-10 22:39  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  NMS parameter defaults were set to bad starting values; fixed.

2007-11-10 13:25  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_potential_calculator.glade,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Added the potential calculator for both PHSV and PCSV.

2007-11-09 21:59  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c:
	  
	  The 'delete-event' signal from the detached windows now properly
	  reattaches the detached window back to the main window.

2007-11-09 21:50  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c:
	  
	  A working example of g_object_[gs]et_data () added. It currently
	  shades the widget that is passed so it renders it useless, but it
	  shows how data passing is done.

2007-11-09 21:02  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui.cbp, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c:
	  
	  The open dialog now also defaults to the PHOEBE_DATA_DIR
	  directory.

2007-11-09 20:45  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c:
	  
	  Added some partially working code for circumventing
	  'delete-event' signal of the detached windows.

2007-11-09 20:29  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/phoebe_gui_error_handling.c, src/phoebe_gui_error_handling.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_main.c:
	  
	  Error handling infrastructure added to PHOEBE GUI. There are
	  three output functions defined:
	  
	  phoebe_gui_output (): general output (unconditional)
	  phoebe_gui_debug (): debug output (conditional) phoebe_gui_fatal
	  (): catch crashes (exits on execution)
	  
	  The debug mode is controlled by gui_verbosity_mode parameter.
	  
	  Next to that, PHOEBE_gui_error_code enum is defined that should
	  hold symbolic names of all exceptions. Right now I put only a
	  generic symbol that should be changed with a real exception. A
	  printing function phoebe_gui_error () has also been added.

2007-11-09 20:26  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Removed the ico.png line from the main glade file, so the
	  annoying error doesn't pop out any more.

2007-11-09 20:19  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added a verbosity-level parameter to the GUI parameter table.

2007-11-09 20:04  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* Makefile.in, glade/Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.in,
	  glade/phoebe_filechooser.glade, glade/phoebe_fitting.glade,
	  glade/phoebe_lc_plot.glade, glade/phoebe_rv_plot.glade,
	  glade/phoebe_warning.glade:
	  
	  Removed all the obsolete glade files still residing in the GUI
	  glade directory.

2007-11-09 19:51  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Removed the popup menus from all the notebooks.

2007-11-09 19:47  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Phase selection now works for LC and RV plots.

2007-11-09 14:07  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The edit functions for RVs and LCs were overwritting the
	  luminosity and limb darkening parameters with default values.
	  Fixed.

2007-11-09 13:53  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui.cbp, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  The computed parameters should refresh properly upon LC/RV
	  plotting now.

2007-11-07 15:24  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_main.c:
	  
	  Command line arguments implemented. Currently the following
	  switches are supported:
	  
	  -h, -? : help -v : version
	  
	  If a parameter file is passed, it will be opened. I had to
	  declare PHOEBE_FILEFLAG and PHOEBE_FILENAME as external in
	  phoebe_gui_callbacks.h.

2007-11-06 19:04  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe_weighting.glade:
	  
	  The hard-coded option "No level-dependent weighting" renamed to
	  "None". The fact that this is hard-coded is a bug and should be
	  fixed.

2007-11-06 18:37  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Parameter alb1 had both lower and upper limits set to 0; fixed.

2007-11-06 04:49  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* configure, configure.ac,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.h,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c,

	  devel/phoebe-scripter/Makefile.in,
	  devel/phoebe-scripter/configure,
	  devel/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_io.c:
	  
	  Correlation matrix computation implemented. Minimizer feedback
	  now features a new field, cormat, that is PHOEBE_matrix that
	  holds the correlation matrix. The scripter has been updated and
	  now prints the correlation matrix along with other minimizer
	  results.
	  
	  To use, simply do:
	  
	  feedback->cormat->val[i][j]
	  
	  where i runs over columns and j runs over rows. See the scripter
	  code for examples.

2007-11-03 18:12  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* AUTHORS, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c:
	  
	  Put a temporary circumvention of the window delete-event function
	  for reparenting. Wow, what a sentence... ;) In a nutshell: the
	  detached window's delete-event is rerouted to a
	  tmp_circumvent_delete_event () function that just prints out a
	  "can't kill me" warning to the terminal. The window thus survives
	  the [x] click and users must reparent it. At the same time this
	  might be a good example on how to do this; if you pass user_data
	  from gui_detach_box_from_parent (), you can have [x] mimick the
	  re-attach behavior.

2007-11-01 16:34  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac,
	  glade/Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.in,
	  glade/phoebe_lc_coefficents.glade,
	  glade/phoebe_lc_coefficients.glade, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.in, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Build files updated in the GUI directory. One glade file was
	  misspelt: coefficents -> coefficients; fixed both here and in the
	  sources. The version bumped up to RC2.

2007-10-31 14:17  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The filechoosers in the LC and RV dialogs now default to the
	  PHOEBE_DATA_DIR directory from Phoebe's configuration.

2007-10-30 14:31  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe_load_rv.glade, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added the "ID" parameters and widgets to gui_widget table, and
	  updated the treeview models. Also made a new entry widget in
	  phoebe_load_rv.glade.
	  
	  If you leave the id entries empty, the filter string should get
	  copied as the id.
	  
	  Test, please.

2007-10-30 04:14  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h,
	  devel/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  The obsolete function query_spectra_repository () removed; printf
	  statements changed to phoebe_debug statements.
	  
	  Also GTK+ dependency stepped down to 2.4 and
	  gtk_window_set_deleteable commented out; this is a
	  semi-accidental commit but it might motivate us to get it fixed
	  sooner. ;)

2007-10-28 08:53  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  The generate spin button in the data tab was still limited to the
	  upper value of 1.5e8. Fixed that. Hope that it will work this
	  time.

2007-10-22 09:26  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe_about.glade:
	  
	  Added emails to the authors list in the about dialog.

2007-10-22 09:23  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe_about.glade:
	  
	  Added the missing phoebe_about.glade file.

2007-10-22 09:17  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* Makefile.in, configure, glade/Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.in,
	  pixmaps/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Added about dialog. Please check some of the Gnome's default
	  applications and their about dialogs and report if you find
	  anything that is still missing in our dialog (other than the
	  artwork).

2007-10-22 02:12  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* glade/phoebe_load_lc.glade,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c:
	  
	  Two new parameters added: phoebe_lc_id and phoebe_rv_id. Both are
	  string arrays and are meant to hold the common name of the
	  light/RV curve that is used for identification. Instead of
	  passband name the curves will be identified by their IDs. These
	  values should be user-defineable; to demonstrate this, I added an
	  entry to phoebe_load_lc glade file, but this entry is not
	  connected with anything at the moment.
	  
	  Next to this I think it would be useful to have a toggle button
	  in the configuration window that would enforce the usage of
	  passbands as identifiers (to offer the old way of referring to
	  curves); in that case the entry would be grayed out and the
	  passband name automatically copied once it's set. Or we could
	  forget about this and have the users set the name to whatever
	  they like.
	  
	  GUI masters, please hook up a widget to phoebe_lc_id and
	  phoebe_rv_id and change the tree models in combo boxes to refer
	  to IDs rather than passband names.
	  
	  This closes bug #1812435.

2007-10-21 10:44  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_load_spots.glade:
	  
	  Changed the order of min and max spin button in the load_spots
	  dialog.

2007-10-21 10:39  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed the order of min and max spin button in the main window.
	  They should be consistent now.

2007-10-17 07:29  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed the upper limit of the generate button in the data tab
	  from 1.5e8 to 2e8.

2007-10-16 19:47  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* configure, configure.ac:
	  
	  The configure script was checking for GTK 2.4 or later whereas it
	  is supposed to check for GTK 2.10 or later; fixed.

2007-10-16 02:54  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.h,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h,
	  devel/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  Function alias_phase_points () renamed to phoebe_curve_alias ().
	  The arguments to this function have been changed to accept
	  PHOEBE_curve instead of PHOEBE_vectors; error handling has also
	  been improved significantly. All drivers have been updated.

2007-10-16 01:51  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c,
	  devel/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_configuration.c:
	  
	  Default configuration directory changed from ~/.phoebe2 to
	  ~/.phoebe-VERSION, i.e. ~/.phoebe-0.30 etc. All drivers updated
	  accordingly.

2007-10-16 00:33  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* README:
	  
	  Rewrapped the text to 80 characters (to conform to terminal
	  specs), and changed some subtle details in text.

2007-10-14 18:51  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* README:
	  
	  I made the README. Please read it and change whatever you (don't)
	  like :)

2007-10-14 16:00  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Implemented the quit dialog.

2007-10-14 15:09  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Data aliasing should also work in the RV plotting tab. But again,
	  sometimes plotting a curve makes phoebe to segfault for an
	  unknown reason.

2007-10-14 15:01  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_global.h:
	  
	  Implemented "Save" functionality. The file name to be saved is
	  remembered upon saving-as and opening. Please, test.

2007-10-14 14:10  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Data aliasing in the LC plotting now kind of works.

2007-10-14 13:30  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h:
	  
	  Added a callback for "Generate seed" button. I took the code from
	  the old version.

2007-10-14 11:04  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Made some minor modifications to the plotting tabs and fixed a
	  typo in the types.c source file.

2007-10-14 10:27  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Added a few lines to the star_name_entry callback so that it now
	  show the main window title with the leading 'PHOEBE' word. This
	  was done for the sake of consistency with the other dialog
	  windows.

2007-10-14 09:57  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added new min and max spinbuttons from the luminosities tab to
	  the widget table.

2007-10-13 19:05  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed properties of all spin button in the main window.

2007-10-13 16:37  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed properties of some spin button in the main window. More
	  coming soon...

2007-10-13 10:30  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Rearranged the Luminosities tab and removed the scripter button
	  in the toolbar.

2007-10-12 18:36  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The critical potential at L1 was incorrectly calculated due to a
	  failure on parameter lookup... Fixed.

2007-10-12 18:29  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Fixed the non-working add, edit and remove buttons in the LC
	  frame of data tab.

2007-10-11 18:37  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, glade/Makefile.in,
	  pixmaps/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  devel/phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.am,
	  devel/phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.in:
	  
	  The names of executables changed from phoebe_scripter and
	  phoebe_gui to phoebe-scripter and phoebe-gui.
	  
	  Please remove the old instances from /usr/local/bin by hand or do
	  a make uninstall *before* you do ./configure.

2007-10-09 22:33  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Removed the "Edit" button from the RV limb darkening frame, and
	  added the min and max spinbuttons to the LC limb darkening frame.
	  Also fixed a minor bug that caused all the LC coefs to take the
	  value of x1 upon editing.

2007-10-09 18:33  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Moved the weighting frame from luminosities to fitting tab and
	  made the minimizer options frame change according to the selected
	  minimizer. I don't know how to make the DC and NMS frames the
	  same size, though, so some "flickering" is present. Gal?

2007-10-09 17:50  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Moved the noise frame from the luminosities to data tab, and made
	  the followup changes to the code.

2007-10-09 17:12  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Made a cell data function to make sure the source strings appear
	  in the spots treeview.

2007-10-02 17:45  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added basic 3D star shape plotting funtion. During testing I got
	  an error that I couldn't reproduce later so I am still not sure
	  why phoebe crashed. If you notice any strange behavior, please
	  report.

2007-10-02 15:01  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.h:
	  
	  Added function that plots the 3D star image. Be aware that it
	  still makes phoebe segfault.

2007-10-01 12:51  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_load_spots.glade,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Reverted back to the Add, Edit and Remove buttons in the Spots
	  tab. Double-clicking the treeview also edits the spot. There are
	  some problems regarding the other widgets - although I select the
	  row that was just added, the spinbuttons and the others don't
	  populate as they should, and you have to click the new row to see
	  the values. Will fix eventually.

2007-10-01 11:37  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Removed the callbacks for the w<->p buttons, and the status
	  printout for saving and opening parameter files: now they report
	  only if they fail.

2007-10-01 11:24  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe_load_lc.glade, glade/phoebe_load_rv.glade,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Done the dynamic population of combos for the RV and LC dialogs
	  as well.

2007-10-01 10:49  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_types.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  Removed the combo-box entries from the glade file. Now they are
	  being added through a gui_init_combo_boxes() function, by reading
	  the parameter menus.

2007-10-01 09:40  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Removed the p->w and w->p buttons. Please report if you find a
	  situation in which you miss them. Also disabled the "Claret
	  (2001)" button in the limb darkening tab.

2007-09-29 17:00  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe_settings.glade, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c:
	  
	  Added PTF_DIR filechooser to the preferences dialog.

2007-09-29 15:28  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Made some cosmetic changes to the main window and some minor
	  changes in the plotting functions.

2007-09-29 14:04  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Critical potential entries in the Sidesheet summary treeview get
	  colored red if surface potentials exceed critical values.

2007-09-29 12:20  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Changed the Crit.pot. in L1,2 entry to \Omega(L_1,2) in the
	  Sidesheet summary treeview. I am not sure if this causes any
	  compatibility issues. Anyway, other entris can also be easily
	  changed if we wish.

2007-09-28 19:11  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Removed the file output "phoebe_out" from the Calculate button
	  callback. The output for the minimizers is now stdout.

2007-09-28 19:07  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Uncommented some lines that shouldn't be commented :)

2007-09-28 18:53  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Fixed the wrong propererties of the X and Y LD LC combo boxes in
	  the plotting tab.

2007-09-28 18:14  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Removed the extra parameter options not supported by the plotting
	  combos.

2007-09-28 18:11  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed the possition of the Correlation Matrix button.

2007-09-27 12:51  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Did some minor updates in the plotting sources.

2007-09-27 09:32  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, phoebe-gui.cbp, src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Removed the unsupported options from Y axis menus in LC and RV
	  plot tabs, arranged the X axis options in correct order and
	  changed the default value of rv_phend from -0.6 to 0.6.

2007-09-27 04:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The default value for phase end was -0.6; changed to 0.6.

2007-09-27 02:41  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_main.c:
	  
	  The call to phoebe_configure () added right after phoebe_init ().
	  Please add any GUI-related configuration between the two calls.

2007-09-26 20:14  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Changed plotting defaults and labels as was requested. While at
	  it, populated the Y axis combos with all possible options.

2007-09-26 18:55  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Fixed the "Data info not updated from parameters" bug. Here's
	  what went wrong: the column-type combos in the LC and RV dialogs
	  are set from the numerical ITYPE, DTYPE and WTYPE columns in the
	  model. However, the columns that are attached to indep, dep, and
	  indweight parameters are the textual columns, ITYPE_STR and so
	  on. So, when opening a parameter file, the text columns would get
	  set, but the numerical columns wouldn't.
	  
	  Fixed the problem by reading the column-type indices from
	  parameters rather than from the model.

2007-09-26 17:38  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Added a gui_ prefix to set_text_view_from_file(),
	  filter_cell_data_func() and detach_box_from_parent() so that all
	  the global functions begin with gui_.

2007-09-26 12:55  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/Makefile.am, glade/Makefile.in, glade/phoebe.glade,
	  glade/phoebe_lc_coefficents.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Added the LC LD edit dialog. RV is coming soon...

2007-09-26 10:34  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Changed the labels for critical potentials in the sidesheet to
	  "Crit. Pot in L1" and "Crit. Pot. in L2".

2007-09-24 14:54  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The options for KIND_MENU gui parameters (lc and rv plot zoom and
	  offset) added to gui_init_parameter_options().

2007-09-24 14:42  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Added the critical potentials to the calculated parameters
	  sidesheet. One thing isn't clear to me, though: the signature of
	  phoebe_calculate_critical_potentials(q, e, F, *L1, *L2) asks for
	  F, the synchronicity parameter; yet there are two synchronicity
	  parameters, one for each component. I presumed phoebe_f1 was the
	  right one?

2007-09-24 13:31  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The save-parameter-file dialogs now ask for overwrite
	  confirmation. Also, the default directory of the add-rv dialog
	  was removed.

2007-09-22 11:28  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The "DC readout fails for passband-dependent parameters" bug is
	  fixed. Now the fitting lists show the array-type parameters
	  properly.
	  
	  However, I spotted another bug here: when a passband dependent
	  parameter is set tba for, say, two current curves, and a third
	  curve is added, the fitting lists don't refresh. Working on it...

2007-09-21 16:36  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Fixed the problem with the Update All button: now the fitting
	  lists update properly as well.

2007-09-21 15:10  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Fixed the Fitting toolbar abutton as well; it was the same issue.

2007-09-21 15:06  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Fixed the issue with detaching the fitting frame. It was caused
	  by (me) renaming GUI_widgets some time ago.

2007-09-19 12:27  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Moved the configuration dialog code to a new function,
	  gui_show_configuration_dialog() in phoebe_gui_accessories.c, and
	  the handlers for the row-changed signals of RV and LC tree models
	  to phoebe_gui_callbacks.c.

2007-09-19 12:06  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Fixed the alignment of the minimizer-feedback label in the
	  fitting tab.

2007-09-19 12:00  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Luminosities, third light and level weighting treeviews made to
	  be editable by double-clicking a row; their respective edit
	  functions moved to phoebe_gui_treeviews.c.

2007-09-19 11:34  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The new spots parameters integrated in GUI. Now the spots tab
	  seems to be completly functional!

2007-09-19 11:19  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Updated the GUI sources to reflect the recent changes in the
	  library.
	  
	  Also added calls to gui_get/set_values_from/to_widgets to open
	  and save toolbutton and menuitem handlers.

2007-09-19 02:47  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fortran_interface.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.h:
	  
	  A triplet of spot parameters, _min, _max, and _step, added to the
	  parameter table. PHOEBE->WD spot conversion function updated.
	  
	  While at it, functions:
	  
	  phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_upper_limit
	  phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_lower_limit
	  
	  renamed to:
	  
	  phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_max phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_min
	  
	  Finally, a one-liner to allow primitive data aliasing for LC
	  curves added to phoebe_gui_plotting. This should be fixed soon.

2007-09-18 17:49  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed the fisrt entry in the LC scatter combobox to "None".

2007-09-18 16:29  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Fixed several misspelled GUI_widget names in gui_init_widget().

2007-09-18 14:04  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  GUI_widgets for phoebe_spots_radius_tba and
	  phoebe_spots_longitude_tba were attached to wrong parameters.
	  Fixed. But there's still a crash when adding some spots, marking
	  them tba, saving, and reopening the parameter file.

2007-09-18 13:35  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Fixed the minimizer feedback label so now it shows the correct
	  minimizer even if no calculation is done.
	  
	  Also attached a model to the second treeview in the fitting tab,
	  but didn't populate it yet.

2007-09-18 12:58  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  The main window title now changes to star name when it is edited.

2007-09-16 21:39  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Made a common callback for all the parameter->tba checkboxes so
	  that the fitting sumary and minimizer feedback treeviews get
	  updated immediately. It appears as if some parameters can't be
	  marked for adjustment together (el3 and opsf, for instance); is
	  this a GUI artifact or a real constraint?
	  
	  Also fixed the segfault caused by a misplaced call to
	  gui_get_values_from_widgets().
	  
	  Most of the changes to phoebe_gui_types.c are cosmetic.

	  Added a box with NMS parameters to the fitting tab, and a label
	  to display minizer status; Andrej, please try it out and see if
	  it performs as expected (the results of NMS don't seem right to
	  me, but I don't know if there's something wrong with the GUI code
	  or if it's a NMS caveat).

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c, devel/phoebe-lib/phoebe-lib.cbp:
	  
	  Added a missing break statement to a switch in
	  gui_get_value_from_widget(). *All* the warnings in w<->p should
	  be gone now.

	  Attached the spots treeview to the new library parameters. The
	  only change in the library itself is the uncommented line
	  defining the tba parameter for a spot. I had to make a lot of
	  small changes to GUI sources to get this through, and not
	  everything is behaving; if you save a parameter file with some
	  spots, chances are Phoebe will segfault when you later open it.
	  
	  I also added a flag to show or not to show all the columns in the
	  spots treeview, so if we decide the users should be able to
	  expand it, we can let them.
	  
	  In the meantime, I fixed the detach button images, which now
	  display properly. Two or three libglade warnings remain, though.

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,

	  Basic LC plotting should now work and should be compatible with

	  manage to make phoebe segfualt, please report. Be aware that
	  plotting empty filename will make just that.

	  Fixed the messed up main window, so it now resizes nicely and the
	  sidesheets detachment works properly. Please do not change te
	  settings of the containers in the main window since it is really
	  hard to find which one causes problems. If we want the overall
	  size of that window to fit on small screens, the only way to do
	  that is to change the containers layout.

2007-09-11 17:34  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  The NMS minimizer now also works if you select it from the combo;
	  but some error handling is in order, as in some situations it
	  segfaults. NMS is called with hard-coded parameters for accuracy
	  (0.1) and max. number of iterations (1): we should think about
	  making an interface for those as well.
	  
	  I also connected the "Update all" button and it works well;
	  however, you need to press the good old "p->w" to see the
	  results.

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_settings.glade,

	  Added callback for the settings dialog. It still not finished and
	  it's causing some strange segfaults.

2007-09-11 13:49  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  The problems I had with starting the minimizer were caused by
	  wrong settings in the config file, and when I fixed that, I
	  discovered an error in the code that caused a segfault. Fixed.
	  The DC minimization now works!

2007-09-11 11:27  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c, devel/phoebe-lib/phoebe-lib.cbp:
	  
	  I made many changes, sorry to put them all in one commit.
	  
	  The most important is the handler for the "Calculate" button on
	  the fitting tab, that now calls DC minimizer. To make this work,
	  I also had to change the way the filters are stored in LC an RV
	  treeviews, and while at that, I moved the add and remove handlers
	  for those treeviews to phoebe_gui_treeviews.c. Then I went on to
	  erase all the empty signal handlers from phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  and to remove them from the glade file as well.
	  
	  I removed the uber "adjustible_spots_model" from
	  phoebe_gui_types.c, but left the other spot-related stuff
	  untouched: I still need to think about the effects the new
	  library functions will have on the current layout and
	  functionality.
	  
	  Last, but not least, I added a return statement to
	  if(!widget->par) block in gui_set/get_values functions, so the "I
	  got where I'm not supposed to get!" warnings are gone.

	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added a new tab for spots. It works like this: click a button to
	  add a spot to the primary or secondary, and then use the
	  spinbuttons below to change the parameters for the selected spot.
	  
	  The sistem isn't quite finished yet: the connection to the
	  library parameters is yet to be implemented, and for some reason
	  the new spots appear as "tba" when they are added to the
	  treeview; also, the spot labels aren't computed properly, add
	  several spots and watch the labels below to see this effect. I'll
	  get back to this tomorrow.
	  
	  There are also some problems in the glade file because I tried to
	  shrink the main window. Will fix later.
	  
	  Until then, try out and comment! Andrej, if you want to change
	  something about the spots in the library, now is a good time to
	  make a review...

2007-09-07 10:21  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Just a minor update: found a way to shrink the tree view columns
	  back. Before that the column would stay extended if you would for
	  example add an entry with a long file name to the LC data tree
	  view. When you would delete that entry, the filename column would
	  still take much space.
	  
	  For now this feature works only with the filename column in the
	  LC data tree view.
	  
	  There is also a function gtk_tree_view_columns_autosize () which
	  (as I understand) would make all the columns in the given tree
	  view autoresize, but I couldn't make it to work.

	  src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  Changed the GUI_widget structure so that it can now hold a
	  pointer to another GUI_widget it depends on. The signatures of
	  gui_widget_add and gui_widget_hookup have been updated
	  accordingly, as well as all the gui_widget_add calls in
	  phoebe_gui_types.c. A new "if" statement in
	  gui_set_value_to_widget function makes sure that a dependancy
	  widget is processed before the dependant widget.
	  
	  Until a function for returning the option index of KIND_MENU
	  parameters is in place, all the combos are getting set to their
	  first (index = 0) item.
	  
	  Because of the timing issues, initialization of
	  phoebe_lc/rv_plot_options_obs_combobox parameters have been moved
	  to separate functions.
	  
	  After these changes, there *should* be no more principal problems
	  with parameter<->widget interchange; however, we heard that
	  before, didn't we?

	  implemented. In order to add a new configuration entry, use:
	  
	  phoebe_config_entry_add (type, keyword, defval);
	  
	  where:
	  
	  type is PHOEBE_type (TYPE_INT, ..., TYPE_STRING)

	  Please take a look at phoebe_configuration.c to see the complete

	  phoebe_config_load (char *filename);
	  
	  phoebe_config_save (char *filename);
	  
	  The only thing that still remains to be done is legacy support.

	  One of the treevies in the fitting tab popluated with LC info.
	  Icons of the main window and of LC and RV dialogs updated to the

	  Pixmaps moved from glade/ to pixmaps/ subdirectory. All
	  installation handlers have been added, plus a new global
	  PHOEBE_GLADE_PIXMAP_DIR string to identify the located pixmaps.
	  Everything is exactly the same as with the recent
	  PHOEBE_GLADE_XML_DIR implementation (see the examples of usage in
	  phoebe_gui_callbacks - I changed all instances of .png files
	  throughout the source), so I won't repeat it here.
	  
	  There is one task for whoever is fastest: please get rid of the
	  hard-coded icons in glade and add the initialization somewhere in
	  the sources. The initialization should be done like this:
	  
	  gchar *glade_pixmap_file = g_build_filename
	  (PHOEBE_GLADE_PIXMAP_DIR, "ico.png", NULL);
	  
	  /* do what is needed, i.e. gtk_window_set_icon (...) */

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,

	  Added very basic LC plotting funcionality. Everything is still
	  very much unstable so phoebe will most likely segfult if
	  something wrong is pressed. It may also cause some problems with
	  the different gnuplot setup.

	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Several changes, most combobox related:
	  
	  1. Removed radio buttons and placed combos instead. Added a combo
	  for phoebe_passband_mode, although I don't know what it's for.
	  
	  2. Checked and double-checked that all the combos have the same
	  options as their parameters. The string that appears in the combo
	  must match exactly its parameter option, or the
	  gui_set_value_to_widget() function will ignore it, or set it the
	  wrong way. As a consequence, the GUI is slightly wider, because
	  of long options of phoebe_model parameter.
	  
	  3. Added "init" functions for lc_obsmenu and rv_obsmenu combos in
	  the plotting tabs. Also added "update" functions that go through
	  the treeviews with data and fill those combos accordingly.
	  Something similar could be done with zoom and offset combos, but
	  I don't think it's essential at the moment.
	  
	  Finaly, I think that, with the exception of all-related-to-spots,
	  the parameter-widget interoperability is now complete.

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added a gui_reinit_treviews() function that goes through all
	  treeviews, clears them of data, and initializes them by adding
	  phoebe_lcno, phoebe_rvno or phoebe_spots_no1(2) empty rows. The
	  function is called just after opening a parameter file, and it is
	  immediately followed by gui_set_values_to_widgets(), which fills
	  the empty rows with data.

	* src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c, src/phoebe_gui_accessories.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Added dialogs for opening and saving Phoebe's parameter files. I
	  placed the gui_open(save)_parameter_file() functions in
	  phoebe_gui_accessories.c.
	  
	  I create the dialogs at runtime (not from glade files) because
	  it's more convenient. The "save" option works like "save as" at
	  the moment, but this can easily be fixed later.
	  
	  Playing with the parameter files, I noticed that
	  gui_set_values_to_widgets() needs more work: if the LC and RV
	  treeviews are ampty, they need to be populated with the stuff
	  from the parameter file... Working on it already.

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Two minor changes:
	  
	  1. the gui_set_values_to_widgets() is now called from the end of
	  gui_init_widgets(), so all the widgets get initialized at
	  startup. But some spin buttons fail to display correct values;
	  I'm investigating this.
	  
	  2. changed the behavior of the main window when it gets resized
	  horizontaly so that now the sidesheets will take up extra space,
	  and the notebook will remain the same.

2007-08-29 11:36  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Updated all the calls to glade_xml_new() in phoebe_gui_callbacks
	  to conform to the new way of referencing glade files.
	  
	  However, the icons (main window icon, "glade/ico.png" and detach
	  icon, "glade/detach.ico") need to be installed as well, and set
	  to the corresponding widgets at runtime, rather than in the glade
	  file.

	  All support files have been adapted accordingly. Currently only a

	  g_free (glade_xml_file);
	  
	  I left the remaining glade_xml_new () calls intact because I'm
	  not sure which .glade files are actually being used. Please
	  update your code to conform to what I'd written above.
	  
	  sudo make install currently installs glade files to the site-wide
	  directory, and the executable phoebe_gui to /usr/local/bin (or
	  whatever prefix the user had chosen). Everything seems to
	  function well with finding the glade files.

	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  The combo boxes are now (almost completly) connected to their
	  parameters. By "almost" I mean that reading the value from the
	  combo to parameter works fine, but I can't set the combo to
	  display the value read from paramter. To do this, we would need
	  to know which option in the parameter's menu is selected by
	  phoebe_parameter_get_value(). Is this possible? If not, can it be
	  done?

2007-08-28 14:50  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The fourth argument (column position) of
	  gtk_tree_view_insert_column(), is now -1 for all the columns,
	  which means that they will appear in their treeviews in the order
	  they are created in.

2007-08-27 14:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  The Problem is fixed. I had to redesign the reference to columns
	  from GtkTreeViewColumn (which pertains to the treeview, thus to
	  the graphical representation of the data) to GtkTreeModel (which
	  pertains to the data themselves). To do this adequately, I had to
	  introduce an auxiliary integer field 'aux' to the GUI_widget
	  structure that holds the column number. All handlers have been
	  updated accordingly, all initializations also, and the new
	  behavior has been tested. Everything seems to check out.
	  
	  What remains is the following:
	  
	  1) Revision of the gui_init_lc_treeviews () function:
	  
	  This needs attention (Olivera?). The list store (model) is
	  created perfectly, but the treeview hookups need to be revised.
	  In particular, the column indices pertain to the *treeview* and
	  not the model, so this needs to be changed.
	  
	  2) Revision of the non-treeview code in gui_get_value_from_widget
	  ():
	  
	  I hope I managed to get the treeview code fully functional, but
	  the remaining parts need attention (Gal?). In particular, there
	  are 5 or so widgets for which the hookup fails, and several
	  handlers are missing. Don't forget that all passband-dependent
	  parameters require 3 arguments to be passed to
	  phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_value, so TYPE_DOUBLE and
	  TYPE_DOUBLE_ARRAY need to be switched separately. I commented out
	  the parts of the code that need to be revised.
	  
	  Mind you, this is a significant change - I hope it won't cause
	  too many conflicts with your local versions...

2007-08-27 11:43  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_main.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Some small issues (such as implicit functions) have been fixed
	  and the Problem has been identified: run phoebe-gui > debug and
	  check the output: some columns return a null pointer at lookup
	  time. The block that supercedes the error messages is the GUI_wt
	  table. You will notice that all widgets that are NULL are missing
	  from the table. Seemingly all it takes is to resolve why the
	  columns are returning NULL widgets.

2007-08-27 03:55  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/Makefile.in, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Several small issues resolved: trailing commas in the enum
	  fields, some mid-code declarations (we should really fix this
	  ASAP: there should be no declarations of variables anywhere
	  except at the beginning of functions or eclosed within {,}), and
	  some indentation. A lot of debugging statements added to
	  gui_get_value_from_widget (). There are still problems with
	  calling phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_value () with the wrong number of
	  arguments; I fixed some, but some seem to still remain.
	  
	  The issue with phoebe_data_lc_indep getting set to "Standard
	  weight" might be connected to the fact that phoebe_data_lc_dep
	  and phoebe_data_lc_wtype do not get passed in
	  gui_get_value_from_widgets (). This is something that I'll
	  investigate next.

2007-08-26 18:51  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_main.c:
	  
	  Header file phoebe_gui_build_config.h was included as a site-wide
	  file, whereas it should have been included as a local file (i.e.
	  "" should have been used instead of <>).

2007-08-26 14:00  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The computed parameters and parameters marked tba now populate
	  the upper and lower sidesheet, respectively, on startup.
	  
	  Also, the spots treeview now shows all the columns from the
	  model, including steps, mins and max's for all four adjustible
	  parameters; as we feared, the treeview is now quite wide, and
	  needs scrolling. But given our limiter time, I suggest we leave
	  it like this for now.
	  
	  While at it, I also done some more changes to the treeviews
	  sources, merging the *_model_create() functions into gui_init_*()
	  functions, so don't be surprised if you get some conflicts...

2007-08-24 15:06  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Removed the logg1 and logg2 widgets from the glade file, and
	  their GUI_widgets from GUI_wt.

	  Added all the treeviews that have previously been declared as

	  all affected sources.

2007-08-24 11:27  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added indexers to the treeview loops in gui_get_value_from_widget

	  src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  Reading in parameters to widgets is now implemented in
	  gui_set_values_to_widgets(). It seems to be working better than
	  its counterpart, and does not break Phoebe when there's data.
	  However, the problem with the RV indep column persists. Also, the
	  combo boxes and the radio buttons are still to be processed both
	  ways.
	  
	  The "Update parameters" button in the GUI has been renamed to
	  "w->p" and another one, "p->w" has been added to call the new
	  parameters->widgets function.
	  
	  This function will also solve the default value problem: since
	  the library parameters are initialized with their default values,
	  calling this function at startup should initialize the widgets to
	  the same defaults...

2007-08-23 14:15  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Progress report on gui_get_values_from_widgets(): I found many
	  more errors in the function (most of them mine, I'm afraid), but
	  fixed almost all.
	  
	  First, in the GTK_IS_TREE_VIEW_COLUMN block, a "GtkTreeIter
	  *iter" was decalred, and used later without the addressof (&)
	  operator. For some reason, this caused the treeviews to become
	  unstable after gui_get_values_from_widgets, and issued a cascade
	  of GTK crtitical warnings in the terminal. Fixed by replacing the
	  declaration with "GtkTreeIter iter" and using "&iter".
	  
	  Second, the GTK_IS_SPIN_BUTTON block didn't check if the
	  widget->type was value, step, min or max, and treated only
	  GUI_WIDGET_VALUE. Fixed.
	  
	  Third, the control integer "status" wasn't initialized, causing
	  the library to print out strange error codes instead of SUCCESS.
	  Fixed.
	  
	  Then, the GUI_WIDGETs that have no associated parameter weren't
	  caught in the main switch statement. Fixed.
	  
	  In the gui_init_widgets() function, some LC related columns were
	  copy-pasted and connected to RV columns by mistake. Partially
	  fixed; there still seems to be some mixing up of columns. In
	  particular, the phoebe_rv_indep is getting set to "Primary RV". I
	  still can't locate this error, but I'm working on it.
	  
	  Some other copy-paste artifacts removed from init_treeviews
	  functions.
	  
	  The final result is the following: without any LC or RV data,
	  gui_get_values_from_widgets works fine. It still segfaults with
	  data. Possibly this is related to the column mix-up. I hope to
	  have it resolved later today, or by latest tomorrow.

	* phoebe-gui.cbp, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,

	  Added a "source_string" field to the spots treeview model, and
	  dropped the cell data function that was doing the index->string
	  conversion until now. I did this only for the sake of consistency
	  with other treeviews, there is no new functionality.

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,

	  Resolved issue that caused a segfault when new LC/RV was added
	  without defined columns. Now there are default values for all
	  three columns in LC and RV dialog.
	  
	  Each new entry (row) in the LC/RV tree view now gets selected
	  when it is added. This helps preventing segfaults that would
	  happen if edit button was pressed but none of the entries were
	  selected.
	  
	  Added (again) a new filed in the LC tree view model for the
	  filter numbers. I don't see any other simple way for referencing
	  filters.

2007-08-22 12:12  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* glade/phoebe.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Filter combo boxes in LC and RV dialogs now work and filter
	  entries in LC/RV tree views are editable. There is still some
	  work to do, though. When edit button is pressed on the selected
	  LC/RV tree view entry, the filter combo box doesn't show
	  previously selected filter.

	* Makefile.in, configure, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_load_lc.glade,

	  Text view in the Load LC dialog now displays the contents of the
	  selected file whenever the signal selection_changed of the
	  filechooser button is transmitted. For now this feature works
	  just in the Add LC dialog.

2007-08-20 13:39  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Another couple of problems resolved: the first one was the
	  occurence char *value in gtk_tree_model_get, which should have
	  been char **value. The second was unreffing the model and the
	  column which are merely pointers to the widgets that should not
	  be unreffed before phoebe_gui_quit (). The function works, but
	  still has some issues to be worked out (see the debugging
	  output):
	  
	  1) passband names in the treeview column do not match those in
	  the lib; 2) fall-through handlers are not in place for widgets
	  that are not linked to parameters, i.e. phoebe_sidesheet_vbox; 3)
	  some exception handlers are invoked that need to be investigated;
	  4) some types are not supported yet; 5) some null iters are
	  processed.
	  
	  The aftermath is that this function sometimes comes through and
	  sometimes it segfaults. Once these issues are all resolved, it is
	  my good faith that everything might Just Work (TM). ;)

2007-08-20 13:04  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  I added code to increase/decrease the phoebe_lcno, phoebe_rvno
	  and phoebe_spots_no1&2 to the signal handlers for add, edit and
	  remove buttons of the corresponding treeviews.

	* glade/phoebe.glade, glade/phoebe_potential_calculator.glade,
	  glade/phoebe_warning.glade:
	  
	  Remodeled Potential calculator window and warning window and
	  added some widgets to the main window.

2007-08-20 04:06  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Another syntax bug removed: function phoebe_parameter_set_value
	  () takes *three* arguments for arrays: the parameter, the index,
	  and the value; in the code only two arguments were passed. The
	  index is now parsed correctly, but the program still segfaults at
	  the gtk_tree_model_iter_next () call.
	  
	  The reason for failure in principle is setting passband-dependent
	  parameters before setting their dependencies properly. For
	  example, setting phoebe_lc_filter[1] will fail unless phoebe_lcno
	  had been set to (at least) 1 before. Function
	  phoebe_parameter_set_value () returns a index-out-of-range error
	  code properly, but the GUI didn't test for this; it now does that
	  as well.
	  
	  I got this far; I'll hopefully be able to continue tomorrow. If
	  anyone else has the time to look into the changes that have been
	  committed now and to pick up troubleshooting from here, that
	  would be great. O:)

2007-08-19 18:02  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Exception handlers added to switch statements. Sorry for some
	  indentation reorganization, I'm a creature of habit! O:)

2007-08-19 17:51  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Function gui_get_values_from_widgets () was changing the global
	  widget table GUI_wt, which invalidated any future reference to
	  that table and caused segfaults. When scanning through a hashed
	  table, a local pointer should be incremented, not the pointer to
	  the global table, otherwise the references to all traversed
	  elements are lost.
	  
	  A temporary debugging statement added; clicking on update
	  parameters still causes a segfault. I'm working on it... ;)

2007-08-18 16:17  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.in, src/phoebe_gui_build_config.h.in,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Build files rebuilt to contain debugging symbols and compiler
	  warnings. At the same time the end-of-list delimiter -1 added to
	  all gtk_tree_model_get () calls.

2007-08-18 16:05  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The fix for the gui_get_value_from_widget function.

2007-08-16 18:55  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Rewritten the TreeViewColumn block of the
	  gui_get_value_from_widget function completly. I'm ashamed to say
	  that I forgot the golden rule and fiddled with the parameters
	  directly, rather than through library functions. I fixed it all
	  now, and as a result, this section doesn't break Phoebe any more
	  (even after the latest fixes, it stil used to segfault if any
	  curves were added). One strange problem remains: after the
	  "Update parameters" is pressed, both LC and RV treevies in the
	  Data tab start behaving strangely...
	  
	  I also made the phoebe_gui_types.c a little more tidy - aligned
	  the code a bit and moved some parts around. There are so many
	  lines of similar code there that it was barely readble. I know
	  this is silly, but please don't discard these changes if they
	  cause conflicts (and they are likely to) - they took me a
	  considerable amount of time. Thank you :)

2007-08-16 15:18  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* src/phoebe_gui_types.c:

	  function to segfault.

2007-08-16 15:05  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Fixed the problem with the doubled passband entries in the "load
	  lc" dialog.

2007-08-16 13:23  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The temporary "Update paramteres" button now attempts to re-fill
	  the sidesheets, showing the parameters that are marked tba. But,
	  unfortunately, it doesn't really work all the time.

2007-08-16 11:19  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h,
	  src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The "sidesheets" now fill up with the parameters from PHOEBE_pt
	  at startup. The upper list is empty because no parameters are
	  marked to be adjusted at that time. However, I'm afraid we won't
	  be able to test this properly before the "update parameters"
	  function(s) are up and running.

	  Added initialization code for the "sidesheets" treeviews.

	* glade/phoebe.glade, phoebe-gui.cbp, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c, src/phoebe_gui_types.c,
	  devel/phoebe-lib/phoebe-lib.cbp:
	  
	  Added a block to gui_get_value_from_widget to handle the
	  TreeViewColumn "widgets". To do this, I had to decorate every
	  column with a set of additional data fields, one being a pointer
	  to its parent TreeView, and the other its column number (these
	  are the changes to phoebe_gui_treeviews.c).
	  
	  To try and test this a bit, I added another toolbutton to the
	  toolbar of the main window, which calls
	  gui_get_values_from_widgets. Right now this call causes a
	  segfault; by commenting pieces of gui_get_value_from_widget I
	  found that the problem is inside the CheckButton and SpinButton
	  blocks, but I don't know what the problem is.

2007-08-03 22:36  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui.cbp, devel/phoebe-lib/phoebe-lib.cbp:
	  
	  I added my CodeBlocks projects to the library and the GUI.

2007-07-31 16:32  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Fixed two mistyped widget declarations in RV add and edit

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Added functionality to the filter combobox in Load LC dialog.
	  Filter name and effective wavelength now show up in the LC
	  treeviews. They still aren't editable though.
	  
	  The mistery with two columned structure of LC combobox remains.
	  It's even stranger beacuse RV filter combobox work perfectly OK.

2007-07-26 10:44  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* glade/phoebe_load_rv.glade, src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Changed the signature of gui_init_filter_combobox from
	  gui_init_filter_combobox(GladeXML*) to
	  gui_init_filter_combobox(GtkWidget*) so that the combos in lc/rv
	  dialogs can be passed to the function. The filters now do show up
	  in the dialogs, but nothing more (can't be "memorized" to the
	  models yet). For some reason, the combo in the lc dialog displays
	  all the filters twice per row, while the rv dialog doesen't, I
	  have no idea why, as the code is almost the same.
	  
	  While at it, I changed the filter button in the
	  phoebe_load_rv.glade to a combobox.

	  the filter selection combobox in the GUI. Sadly, something
	  doesn't work as it should, so nothing show up in the combobox :(

	  While at it, the GUI auto* files have been regenerated from

	  about a missing ChangeLog, just touch it and rerun it, then it
	  will work just fine.

	  Added gui_widget_lookup() function to the phoebe_gui_types source

	  Added (experimental) detach functionality to the sidesheets.
	  Click on the small button above the sidesheets now detaches and

	  Also, the phoebe_gui_global.h was created in order to hold all

	  Following Andrej's advice, the conversion from combobox indices
	  to human readable strings is done trough the option menu of
	  PHOEBE_parameter in question. The items in the combos are now
	  copied from the library, but still hard-coded in the glade files.

	* src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c, src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  The "edit" buttons for data->lc, data->rv and spots treeviews now
	  work. Only elementary error handling is in place, so some
	  warnings may appear when doing strange things (like adding a
	  curve with no filename).
	  
	  The other thing is more subtle, and open for discussion. So far
	  the column types for LCs and RVs and the source of the spots were
	  kept as strings in the models. However, they appear as combobox
	  widgets in the GUI, and combos reffer to their items by integer
	  indices. To get around this, I changed the models to contain
	  integers instead, and added a series of "cell data functions"
	  that render these indices as corresponding strings in the views.
	  However, this might proove to be a performance issue, as these
	  functions are called quite often by the treeviews... I haven't
	  noticed any impact on my (quite low-end) machine, but I thought
	  it was worth mentioning anyway.

	  1. Expanded the treeview model for spots, so that it now contains
	  adjustment information for all spot parameters.
	  
	  2. Turned the load-lc, load-rv and load-spots windows to
	  GtkDialogs. Now all the widgets inside these windows are declared
	  and initialized upon opening the dialog, and destroyed with the
	  dialog after it returns control to the main window. If "OK" is
	  pressed, the widgets are read out, and their values are assigned
	  to a new row of the corresponding treeview model. Parameters that
	  aren't entered trough these dialogs are still hard-coded to their
	  default values.
	  
	  3. Deleted some obsolete signals from phoebe.glade, and removed
	  the lot of signal handlers for the above-mentioned dialogs from
	  phoebe_gui_callbakcs.

	* glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Modified the main window. Plotting windows are no longer separate
	  but are merged inside the main window. Both (LC and RV) plotting
	  tabs will get a button that will enable user to detach the tabs
	  from the main window.
	  
	  Fitting window was included in the main window in the same manner
	  and it will also get detach fucntionality.
	  
	  Spots tab was merged with the surface tab since we only need one
	  treeview that will cover all the spots.

	  Added a toggle button and a spinn button for phoebe_extinction
	  parameter to main window -> luminosities -> third light section,
	  and hooked them up. Also hooked up all the passband dependant and
	  RV parameters to their respective treeview columns (again).
	  
	  Finally, connected the "toggled" signal to the "active" toggle
	  buttons in phoebe_data_lc/rv_treeviews. Now the toggles are
	  clickable and do indeed toggle, but GLib issues a warning I don't
	  quite know what to do about upon clikcing them.

	* trunk/phoebe-gui/configure, trunk/phoebe-gui/configure.ac,
	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/configure,
	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/configure.ac:
	  
	  An autoconf checkup added for the presence of PHOEBE library. If
	  it is absent, ./configure stops with a failure.

	* trunk/phoebe-gui/src/main.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.file_select.glade,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.logging.glade,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.main.glade,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.plot_lc.glade,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui.potential_calc.glade,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h,
	  trunk/phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_global.h:
	  
	  A few callbacks regarding ephemeris and system parameters were
	  added. Callbacks are now arranged in order that follows PHOEBE's
	  structure. That means that menubar callbacks are in the beging of
	  file followed by toolbar, data, ephemeris and so on. Also
	  frequently used callbacks like ones setting PHOEBE's parameters
	  were put in separate category.

	* trunk/phoebe-gui/ChangeLog:
	  
	  Following the change of SPECS established on Oct 18, the
	  ChangeLog is removed from the CVS. It will now be created for the
	  distribution by issuing:
	  
	  rcs2log -i 2 > ChangeLog
	  
	  This means that the ChangeLog build is now completely up to CVS
	  and that the developers must describe the commited changes
	  properly, not merely by the change date anymore.
