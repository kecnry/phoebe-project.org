        * PHOEBE 0.30RC1 released.

2007-10-16 02:54  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.h,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  Function alias_phase_points () renamed to phoebe_curve_alias ().
	  The arguments to this function have been changed to accept
	  PHOEBE_curve instead of PHOEBE_vectors; error handling has also
	  been improved significantly. All drivers have been updated.

2007-10-16 01:51  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_configuration.c:
	  
	  Default configuration directory changed from ~/.phoebe2 to
	  ~/.phoebe-VERSION, i.e. ~/.phoebe-0.30 etc. All drivers updated
	  accordingly.

2007-10-16 00:33  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/README:
	  
	  Rewrapped the text to 80 characters (to conform to terminal
	  specs), and changed some subtle details in text.

2007-10-16 00:32  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* AUTHORS:
	  
	  Added Tomaz Zwitter to the list of contributors.

2007-10-14 18:51  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/README:
	  
	  I made the README. Please read it and change whatever you (don't)
	  like :)

2007-10-14 16:00  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_accessories.h,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Implemented the quit dialog.

2007-10-14 15:09  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Data aliasing should also work in the RV plotting tab. But again,
	  sometimes plotting a curve makes phoebe to segfault for an
	  unknown reason.

2007-10-14 15:01  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_global.h:
	  
	  Implemented "Save" functionality. The file name to be saved is
	  remembered upon saving-as and opening. Please, test.

2007-10-14 14:10  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Data aliasing in the LC plotting now kind of works.

2007-10-14 13:30  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h:
	  
	  Added a callback for "Generate seed" button. I took the code from
	  the old version.

2007-10-14 11:04  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Made some minor modifications to the plotting tabs and fixed a
	  typo in the types.c source file.

2007-10-14 10:27  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Added a few lines to the star_name_entry callback so that it now
	  show the main window title with the leading 'PHOEBE' word. This
	  was done for the sake of consistency with the other dialog
	  windows.

2007-10-14 09:57  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added new min and max spinbuttons from the luminosities tab to
	  the widget table.

2007-10-13 19:05  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed properties of all spin button in the main window.

2007-10-13 16:37  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Changed properties of some spin button in the main window. More
	  coming soon...

2007-10-13 10:30  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Rearranged the Luminosities tab and removed the scripter button
	  in the toolbar.

2007-10-12 18:36  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  The critical potential at L1 was incorrectly calculated due to a
	  failure on parameter lookup... Fixed.

2007-10-12 18:29  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Fixed the non-working add, edit and remove buttons in the LC
	  frame of data tab.

2007-10-11 20:24  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fortran_interface.c:
	  
	  Memory corruption in DC fixed as well! Hopefully this resolves
	  the spots bug completely! Please test and report any issues you
	  might have.

2007-10-11 19:36  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
	  
	  Removed debug printf() statements.

2007-10-11 19:35  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fortran_interface.c:
	  
	  Fixed a memory corruption bug in the spots section.

2007-10-11 19:13  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
	  
	  Several other instances of errors changed to warnings.

2007-10-11 18:53  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c:
	  
	  If a qualifier is not recognized, a warning is now issued instead
	  of a lib error.

2007-10-11 18:37  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/Makefile.in, phoebe-gui/configure,
	  phoebe-gui/configure.ac, phoebe-gui/glade/Makefile.in,
	  phoebe-gui/pixmaps/Makefile.in, phoebe-gui/src/Makefile.am,
	  phoebe-gui/src/Makefile.in, phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.am,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.in:
	  
	  The names of executables changed from phoebe_scripter and
	  phoebe_gui to phoebe-scripter and phoebe-gui.
	  
	  Please remove the old instances from /usr/local/bin by hand or do
	  a make uninstall *before* you do ./configure.

2007-10-09 22:33  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Removed the "Edit" button from the RV limb darkening frame, and
	  added the min and max spinbuttons to the LC limb darkening frame.
	  Also fixed a minor bug that caused all the LC coefs to take the
	  value of x1 upon editing.

2007-10-09 18:33  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Moved the weighting frame from luminosities to fitting tab and
	  made the minimizer options frame change according to the selected
	  minimizer. I don't know how to make the DC and NMS frames the
	  same size, though, so some "flickering" is present. Gal?

2007-10-09 17:50  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Moved the noise frame from the luminosities to data tab, and made
	  the followup changes to the code.

2007-10-09 17:12  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Made a cell data function to make sure the source strings appear
	  in the spots treeview.

2007-10-09 04:02  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  Scripter command column () can now read in any type of columns,
	  including non-numeric data like strings.
	  
	  Built-in command dim() now returns the dimension of arrays as
	  well.

2007-10-09 04:00  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
	  
	  Function phoebe_array_new_from_column () implemented. This
	  function can automatically determine the type of data contained
	  in the given column (it parses the first element and infers the
	  type of the whole column from its type).
	  
	  Function phoebe_vector_new_from_array () implemented. This
	  function simply transforms numeric arrays (TYPE_INT_ARRAY and
	  TYPE_DOUBLE_ARRAY) to vectors.

2007-10-03 07:27  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
	  
	  Fixed a typo in the for loop that caused repository query to
	  segfault if there were more logg values than metallicities.

2007-10-03 07:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.h,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
	  
	  Backend for accessing the repository of stellar spectra
	  completely reworked. When I say completly, I really mean it ;) -
	  PHOEBE now supports Munari et al. (2005) spectra. Function
	  query_spectra_repository is obsolete and replaced by
	  phoebe_spectra_set_repository (). This function accesses the
	  directory given as argument and recursively builds a table of all
	  spectra that is stored in a global PHOEBE_spectra_repository
	  variable. I think the logic of creating a grid table is nifty, so
	  I briefly explain it here:
	  
	  1) The directory is read recursively and all filenames are
	  parsed. The ones that enter the repository (no rotational
	  velocity and no alpha/Fe) are added to the array of spectra in
	  order of appearance. We omit rotational velocities because there
	  is a dedicated function in PHOEBE to do just that. Alpha
	  enhancement may enter some time later, but I'm not sure yet how
	  realistic it is.
	  
	  2) During the parsing stage, all unique T/log(g)/[M/H] are
	  stored, each in a separate array within the
	  PHOEBE_spectra_repository structure (these arrays are called
	  Teffnodes, loggnodes, and metnodes).
	  
	  3) Once the directory tree is traversed, we build a 3D grid based
	  on the nodes obtained in step 2. All elements of this grid will
	  be pointers to spectra found and stored in step 1.
	  
	  4) We do a second pass over all found spectra and, knowing the
	  geometry of the table, we link each table element to the
	  corresponding spectrum.
	  
	  Once all that is done, there is PHOEBE_spectra_repository.table
	  field that holds the pointers to all spectra in tabular form. The
	  file of the spectrum, when needed, is accessed by getting the
	  indices i, j, k, and opening
	  PHOEBE_spectra_repository.table[i][j][k]->filename. That's all
	  there's to it, but the change is substantial. Multi-D
	  interpolation has not been updated, that's next.

2007-10-02 17:45  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Added basic 3D star shape plotting funtion. During testing I got
	  an error that I couldn't reproduce later so I am still not sure
	  why phoebe crashed. If you notice any strange behavior, please
	  report.

2007-10-02 15:01  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.h:
	  
	  Added function that plots the 3D star image. Be aware that it
	  still makes phoebe segfault.

2007-10-02 07:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
	  
	  All reallocation functions revised to allow size 0; in those
	  cases the contents of the arrays are freed and array pointers are
	  set to NULL. This solves the problem of setting the modifiers
	  (lcno, rvno, spots_no, ...) to 0 and getting a series of invalid
	  reallocations.

2007-10-01 12:51  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe_load_spots.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.h,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Reverted back to the Add, Edit and Remove buttons in the Spots
	  tab. Double-clicking the treeview also edits the spot. There are
	  some problems regarding the other widgets - although I select the
	  row that was just added, the spinbuttons and the others don't
	  populate as they should, and you have to click the new row to see
	  the values. Will fix eventually.

2007-10-01 11:37  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Removed the callbacks for the w<->p buttons, and the status
	  printout for saving and opening parameter files: now they report
	  only if they fail.

2007-10-01 11:24  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe_load_lc.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe_load_rv.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Done the dynamic population of combos for the RV and LC dialogs
	  as well.

2007-10-01 10:49  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  Removed the combo-box entries from the glade file. Now they are
	  being added through a gui_init_combo_boxes() function, by reading
	  the parameter menus.

2007-10-01 09:40  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade:
	  
	  Removed the p->w and w->p buttons. Please report if you find a
	  situation in which you miss them. Also disabled the "Claret
	  (2001)" button in the limb darkening tab.

2007-09-30 15:24  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.h:
	  
	  Scripter command plot_eb_using_gnuplot () committed.

2007-09-29 21:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.h,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fortran_interface.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h, phoebe-lib/libwd/lc.sub.f,
	  phoebe-lib/libwd/wd.h:
	  
	  1) Rudimentary image plotting implemented. Use the function:
	  
	  call_wd_to_get_pos_coordinates ( PHOEBE_vector *poscoy,
	  PHOEBE_vector *poscoz, double phase)
	  
	  to read in the values of the plane-of-sky (pos) coordinates at
	  the given phase. To see it in action, use plot_eb_using_gnuplot
	  (phase) command in the scripter, and phoebe_scripter_commands.c
	  sources as an example of a working implementation.
	  
	  There are several problems, though:
	  
	  a) the number of data points vary with phase and cannot be
	  reliably predicted without computing the whole model. The
	  eclipsed parts of the image will thus show the (0,0) point
	  (center of mass) although that point shouldn't be visible;
	  
	  b) when there are spots in the system, the vectors may get
	  overflown. I haven't yet tried this, but I'm pretty sure it will
	  segfault;
	  
	  c) the aspect ratio in the plotting window is messed up because
	  of the automatic scaling of axes.
	  
	  I will work on solving these problems, but this should get you
	  from square 1 in implementing the plotting capability in the GUI.
	  
	  2) The default resampling mode changed from
	  PHOEBE_HIST_CONSERVE_DENSITY to PHOEBE_HIST_CONSERVE_VALUES.
	  
	  3) When multiplying two spectra, resampling is now done over the
	  whole range of the resultant spectrum rather than on the range of
	  each separate spectrum.

2007-09-29 17:00  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe_settings.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_accessories.c:
	  
	  Added PTF_DIR filechooser to the preferences dialog.

2007-09-29 15:28  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Critical potential entries in the Sidesheet summary treeview get
	  colored red if surface potentials exceed critical values.

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Changed the Crit.pot. in L1,2 entry to \Omega(L_1,2) in the
	  Sidesheet summary treeview. I am not sure if this causes any
	  compatibility issues. Anyway, other entris can also be easily
	  changed if we wish.

2007-09-28 19:11  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Removed the file output "phoebe_out" from the Calculate button
	  callback. The output for the minimizers is now stdout.

2007-09-28 19:07  Gal Matijevič <gal.matijevic@fmf.uni-lj.si>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c:
	  
	  Uncommented some lines that shouldn't be commented :)

	  Fixed the wrong propererties of the X and Y LD LC combo boxes in
	  the plotting tab.

2007-09-28 18:14  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:

	  Did some minor updates in the plotting sources.

2007-09-27 09:32  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade, phoebe-gui/phoebe-gui.cbp,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_plotting.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Removed the unsupported options from Y axis menus in LC and RV
	  plot tabs, arranged the X axis options in correct order and
	  changed the default value of rv_phend from -0.6 to 0.6.

2007-09-27 04:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The default value for phase end was -0.6; changed to 0.6.

2007-09-27 03:02  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-scripter/help/get_spectrum_from_repository.help,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c:
	  
	  Help system in the scripter slightly reworked - the directives
	  are now automatically switched rather than going through the

	  The help file for get_spectrum_from_repository () added.

	  The code adapted to the configuration changes. Two configuration
	  entries added: SCRIPTER_HOME_DIR and SCRIPTER_HELP_DIR.
	  
	  Readline now works with the -c switch (the problem was in the

	  (); phoebe_free_config_entries () renamed to phoebe_config_free
	  ();
	  
	  PHOEBE configuration optimized. The phoebe_init () function has
	  been split into phoebe_init () and phoebe_configure (); the first
	  function initializes all config-independent variables, and the
	  second initializes and populates all config-dependent variables
	  including parameters (parameters depend on the supported passband
	  transmission functions, that is why they are declared in the
	  configuration stage).
	  
	  This change has been made so that the drivers (the scripter and
	  the GUI) can add their own configuration between the two calls.
	  For example, one could do:
	  
	  phoebe_init (); scripter_config_populate (); phoebe_configure ();
	  
	  where scripter_config_populate () is the analog to
	  phoebe_config_populate () that adds scripter config entries.
	  Please make sure phoebe_configure () is called before any tables
	  are accessed, as they won't be defined otherwise.

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Fixed the "Data info not updated from parameters" bug. Here's
	  what went wrong: the column-type combos in the LC and RV dialogs
	  are set from the numerical ITYPE, DTYPE and WTYPE columns in the
	  model. However, the columns that are attached to indep, dep, and
	  indweight parameters are the textual columns, ITYPE_STR and so
	  on. So, when opening a parameter file, the text columns would get
	  set, but the numerical columns wouldn't.
	  
	  Fixed the problem by reading the column-type indices from
	  parameters rather than from the model.

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Added the critical potentials to the calculated parameters
	  sidesheet. One thing isn't clear to me, though: the signature of
	  phoebe_calculate_critical_potentials(q, e, F, *L1, *L2) asks for
	  F, the synchronicity parameter; yet there are two synchronicity
	  parameters, one for each component. I presumed phoebe_f1 was the

	* phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.lex:
	  
	  Built-in function isnan () added to the scripter. This function
	  tests whether the passed argument is nan (not a number). If it
	  is, it returns true, and if it is not, it returns false.
	  
	  Examples:
	  
	  isnan (5) returns TRUE isnan (sqrt (-1)) returns FALSE
	  
	  This is primarily intended to catch DC divergence, i.e. something
	  like:
	  
	  set result = minimize_using_dc () for (k = 1; k <= PARS_TBA; k++)
	  if (isnan (result.newvals[k])) print "DC diverged."

	  The "DC readout fails for passband-dependent parameters" bug is

	  properly.
	  
	  However, I spotted another bug here: when a passband dependent

	  curve is added, the fitting lists don't refresh. Working on it...

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fortran_interface.c:
	  
	  Casting from C to Fortran types in DCI structure readout done for

	  While at it, functions:

	  phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_lower_limit
	  
	  renamed to:
	  
	  phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_max phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_min
	  
	  Finally, a one-liner to allow primitive data aliasing for LC

	  Fixed the minimizer feedback label so now it shows the correct
	  minimizer even if no calculation is done.
	  
	  Also attached a model to the second treeview in the fitting tab,
	  but didn't populate it yet.

	  Third light handling fully functional. The handler for 3rd light
	  that is passed as the percentage of 3rd luminosity, namely
	  x=L3/(L1+L2+L3), has been implemented in WD natively and will be
	  proposed to upstream for incorporation in future WD versions. A
	  new switch L3perc, passed in the argument list to lc.sub.f and

	  Made a common callback for all the parameter->tba checkboxes so
	  that the fitting sumary and minimizer feedback treeviews get
	  updated immediately. It appears as if some parameters can't be
	  marked for adjustment together (el3 and opsf, for instance); is
	  this a GUI artifact or a real constraint?

	  phoebe_spots_colatitude_tba phoebe_spots_longitude_tba
	  phoebe_spots_radius_tba phoebe_spots_tempfactor_tba
	  
	  These are all boolean arrays and expect 1 or 0 (TRUE or FALSE)
	  for each spot separately. The newly implemented function
	  wd_spots_parameters_get () is a wrapper that transfers the data
	  from PHOEBE spots parameters phoebe_spots_* to WD spots
	  parameters wd_spots_*. This is done to temporarily (until we
	  implement our version of DC) support up to two adjustable spots
	  in DC *and/or* NMS.
	  
	  To recap: if you want to adjust, say, radius of the third spot
	  and colatitude on the fourth spot, you would set:
	  
	  phoebe_parameter_set_value (phoebe_spots_radius_tba, 1, 3);
	  phoebe_parameter_set_value (phoebe_spots_colatitude_tba, 1, 4);
	  
	  Note that the source star for these spots is defined by the 3rd
	  and 4th element of the phoebe_spots_source parameter.

	  Attached the spots treeview to the new library parameters. The
	  only change in the library itself is the uncommented line
	  defining the tba parameter for a spot. I had to make a lot of
	  small changes to GUI sources to get this through, and not
	  everything is behaving; if you save a parameter file with some
	  spots, chances are Phoebe will segfault when you later open it.
	  
	  I also added a flag to show or not to show all the columns in the
	  spots treeview, so if we decide the users should be able to
	  expand it, we can let them.
	  
	  In the meantime, I fixed the detach button images, which now

	  settings of the containers in the main window since it is really
	  hard to find which one causes problems. If we want the overall
	  size of that window to fit on small screens, the only way to do
	  that is to change the containers layout.

	  Sigh... After implementing everything in phoebe_spots.c, I
	  realized it is not a good way to go because it deviates from the
	  rest of the code too much. As consequence I ditched the
	  structures and introduced some additional spot parameters
	  instead.
	  
	  The layout is now the following:
	  
	  1) Hook up tree-view spot parameters to:
	  
	  phoebe_spots_no phoebe_spots_active_switch phoebe_spots_source
	  phoebe_spots_colatitude phoebe_spots_longitude
	  phoebe_spots_radius phoebe_spots_tempfactor
	  
	  2) Adjustable widgets below the tree-view pertain to:
	  
	  wd_spots_lat1 wd_spots_long1 wd_spots_rad1 wd_spots_temp1
	  wd_spots_lat2 wd_spots_long2 wd_spots_rad2 wd_spots_temp2
	  
	  However, the correspondence is not 1:1 because there can be many
	  spots on either star. The "trick" is to use
	  phoebe_spots_tba_switch, which is defined in phoebe_parameters.c
	  but currently commented out. If you want to use it, just
	  uncomment it. I commented it out because I wanted to give it a
	  bit more thought as to what would be optimal.
	  
	  The changes to the code to reflect these changes in organization
	  are close to complete. It's up to the driving program to assign
	  values to wd_spots_* properly, but this might be better in the
	  library. I have to think about this a little bit more.
	  
	  While changing everything, qualifiers phoebe_spots_move1 and
	  phoebe_spots_move2 renamed to phoebe_spots_corotate1 and
	  phoebe_spots_corotate2. I suggest a similar renaming of the
	  corresponding check-buttons in the GUI.

	  segfaults. NMS is called with hard-coded parameters for accuracy
	  (0.1) and max. number of iterations (1): we should think about
	  making an interface for those as well.
	  
	  I also connected the "Update all" button and it works well;
	  however, you need to press the good old "p->w" to see the
	  results.

	  I made many changes, sorry to put them all in one commit.
	  
	  The most important is the handler for the "Calculate" button on
	  the fitting tab, that now calls DC minimizer. To make this work,
	  I also had to change the way the filters are stored in LC an RV
	  treeviews, and while at that, I moved the add and remove handlers
	  for those treeviews to phoebe_gui_treeviews.c. Then I went on to
	  erase all the empty signal handlers from phoebe_gui_callbacks.c,
	  and to remove them from the glade file as well.
	  
	  I removed the uber "adjustible_spots_model" from
	  phoebe_gui_types.c, but left the other spot-related stuff
	  untouched: I still need to think about the effects the new
	  library functions will have on the current layout and
	  functionality.
	  
	  Last, but not least, I added a return statement to
	  if(!widget->par) block in gui_set/get_values functions, so the "I
	  got where I'm not supposed to get!" warnings are gone.

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spots.c,

	  Prototypes for spot handling functions have been defined. Please
	  review and comment. In brief: PHOEBE_spot is a new typedef'fed
	  structure that holds all the info on a given spot. All spots are
	  added consequentially to a global linked list table PHOEBE_spots.
	  Two spots that are adjustable by DC are passed by the
	  phoebe_spot_pass_to_wd () function; it takes two arguments, a
	  pointer to the spot and the adjustable spot number, which can be
	  1 or 2. All other info on a given spot is in the structure, so no
	  need to pass it again. Step sizes, mins and maxes are independent
	  parameters that are exclusive to DC and apply to all spots
	  equally, that's why they don't appear in the structure.
	  
	  These are only the prototypes, functions have not been written
	  yet. I hope to do most of it tomorrow afternoon, so please
	  comment ASAP if you can think of anything that can be done
	  better.

	  Added a new tab for spots. It works like this: click a button to
	  add a spot to the primary or secondary, and then use the
	  spinbuttons below to change the parameters for the selected spot.
	  
	  The sistem isn't quite finished yet: the connection to the
	  library parameters is yet to be implemented, and for some reason
	  the new spots appear as "tba" when they are added to the
	  treeview; also, the spot labels aren't computed properly, add
	  several spots and watch the labels below to see this effect. I'll
	  get back to this tomorrow.
	  
	  There are also some problems in the glade file because I tried to
	  shrink the main window. Will fix later.
	  
	  Until then, try out and comment! Andrej, if you want to change
	  something about the spots in the library, now is a good time to

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c:
	  
	  Just a minor update: found a way to shrink the tree view columns
	  back. Before that the column would stay extended if you would for
	  example add an entry with a long file name to the LC data tree
	  view. When you would delete that entry, the filename column would
	  still take much space.
	  
	  For now this feature works only with the filename column in the
	  LC data tree view.
	  
	  There is also a function gtk_tree_view_columns_autosize () which
	  (as I understand) would make all the columns in the given tree
	  view autoresize, but I couldn't make it to work.

	  always) and -A invokes ANSI compliance of the produced code.
	  
	  At the same time some extra spaces have been removed from wrlci.
	  After 2 days of witchhunt, I finally isolated the f_open()
	  problem: it's a 64bit bug in Debian and has nothing to do with

	  double. To accomodate for this, a whole range of changes had to
	  be introduced:
	  
	  1) the fields in the WD_LCI_parameters and WD_DCI_parameters have
	  been changed from int, bool and double to integer and doublereal,

	  phoebe_config_load (char *filename);
	  
	  phoebe_config_save (char *filename);
	  
	  The only thing that still remains to be done is legacy support.

	  /* do what is needed, i.e. gtk_window_set_icon (...) */

	  Several changes, most combobox related:
	  
	  1. Removed radio buttons and placed combos instead. Added a combo
	  for phoebe_passband_mode, although I don't know what it's for.
	  
	  2. Checked and double-checked that all the combos have the same
	  options as their parameters. The string that appears in the combo
	  must match exactly its parameter option, or the
	  gui_set_value_to_widget() function will ignore it, or set it the
	  wrong way. As a consequence, the GUI is slightly wider, because
	  of long options of phoebe_model parameter.
	  
	  3. Added "init" functions for lc_obsmenu and rv_obsmenu combos in
	  the plotting tabs. Also added "update" functions that go through
	  the treeviews with data and fill those combos accordingly.
	  Something similar could be done with zoom and offset combos, but
	  I don't think it's essential at the moment.
	  
	  Finaly, I think that, with the exception of all-related-to-spots,
	  the parameter-widget interoperability is now complete.

	  Added a gui_reinit_treviews() function that goes through all
	  treeviews, clears them of data, and initializes them by adding
	  phoebe_lcno, phoebe_rvno or phoebe_spots_no1(2) empty rows. The
	  function is called just after opening a parameter file, and it is
	  immediately followed by gui_set_values_to_widgets(), which fills
	  the empty rows with data.

	  Added dialogs for opening and saving Phoebe's parameter files. I
	  placed the gui_open(save)_parameter_file() functions in
	  phoebe_gui_accessories.c.
	  
	  I create the dialogs at runtime (not from glade files) because
	  it's more convenient. The "save" option works like "save as" at
	  the moment, but this can easily be fixed later.
	  
	  Playing with the parameter files, I noticed that
	  gui_set_values_to_widgets() needs more work: if the LC and RV
	  treeviews are ampty, they need to be populated with the stuff
	  from the parameter file... Working on it already.

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade, phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Two minor changes:
	  
	  1. the gui_set_values_to_widgets() is now called from the end of
	  gui_init_widgets(), so all the widgets get initialized at
	  startup. But some spin buttons fail to display correct values;
	  I'm investigating this.
	  
	  2. changed the behavior of the main window when it gets resized
	  horizontaly so that now the sidesheets will take up extra space,
	  and the notebook will remain the same.

2007-08-29 11:36  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  Updated all the calls to glade_xml_new() in phoebe_gui_callbacks
	  to conform to the new way of referencing glade files.
	  
	  However, the icons (main window icon, "glade/ico.png" and detach
	  icon, "glade/detach.ico") need to be installed as well, and set
	  to the corresponding widgets at runtime, rather than in the glade
	  file.

	  Glade files are now sought in 4 places, consecutively:
	  
	  1) current working directory, 2) global installation directory
	  (/usr/local/share/phoebe/gui/glade), 3) ../glade/ directory and
	  4) glade/ directory.
	  
	  If glade files are not found, the program bails out.
	  
	  All support files have been adapted accordingly. Currently only a
	  single glade file is referenced as it is supposed to, namely:
	  
	  gchar *glade_xml_file = g_build_filename ( PHOEBE_GLADE_XML_DIR,
	  "phoebe.glade");
	  
	  window = glade_xml_new (glade_xml_file, NULL, NULL);
	  
	  g_free (glade_xml_file);
	  
	  I left the remaining glade_xml_new () calls intact because I'm
	  not sure which .glade files are actually being used. Please
	  update your code to conform to what I'd written above.
	  
	  sudo make install currently installs glade files to the site-wide
	  directory, and the executable phoebe_gui to /usr/local/bin (or
	  whatever prefix the user had chosen). Everything seems to
	  function well with finding the glade files.

	  to know which option in the parameter's menu is selected by

	  The fourth argument (column position) of

	  which means that they will appear in their treeviews in the order
	  they are created in.

2007-08-27 14:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  The Problem is fixed. I had to redesign the reference to columns
	  from GtkTreeViewColumn (which pertains to the treeview, thus to
	  the graphical representation of the data) to GtkTreeModel (which
	  pertains to the data themselves). To do this adequately, I had to
	  introduce an auxiliary integer field 'aux' to the GUI_widget
	  structure that holds the column number. All handlers have been
	  updated accordingly, all initializations also, and the new
	  behavior has been tested. Everything seems to check out.
	  
	  What remains is the following:
	  
	  1) Revision of the gui_init_lc_treeviews () function:
	  
	  This needs attention (Olivera?). The list store (model) is
	  created perfectly, but the treeview hookups need to be revised.
	  In particular, the column indices pertain to the *treeview* and
	  not the model, so this needs to be changed.
	  
	  2) Revision of the non-treeview code in gui_get_value_from_widget
	  ():
	  
	  I hope I managed to get the treeview code fully functional, but
	  the remaining parts need attention (Gal?). In particular, there
	  are 5 or so widgets for which the hookup fails, and several
	  handlers are missing. Don't forget that all passband-dependent
	  parameters require 3 arguments to be passed to
	  phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_value, so TYPE_DOUBLE and
	  TYPE_DOUBLE_ARRAY need to be switched separately. I commented out
	  the parts of the code that need to be revised.
	  
	  Mind you, this is a significant change - I hope it won't cause
	  too many conflicts with your local versions...

	  Some small issues (such as implicit functions) have been fixed
	  and the Problem has been identified: run phoebe-gui > debug and
	  check the output: some columns return a null pointer at lookup
	  time. The block that supercedes the error messages is the GUI_wt
	  table. You will notice that all widgets that are NULL are missing
	  from the table. Seemingly all it takes is to resolve why the
	  columns are returning NULL widgets.

	  Several small issues resolved: trailing commas in the enum
	  fields, some mid-code declarations (we should really fix this
	  ASAP: there should be no declarations of variables anywhere
	  except at the beginning of functions or eclosed within {,}), and
	  some indentation. A lot of debugging statements added to
	  gui_get_value_from_widget (). There are still problems with
	  calling phoebe_parameter_[gs]et_value () with the wrong number of
	  arguments; I fixed some, but some seem to still remain.
	  
	  The issue with phoebe_data_lc_indep getting set to "Standard
	  weight" might be connected to the fact that phoebe_data_lc_dep
	  and phoebe_data_lc_wtype do not get passed in
	  gui_get_value_from_widgets (). This is something that I'll
	  investigate next.

	  The computed parameters and parameters marked tba now populate

	  Also, the spots treeview now shows all the columns from the
	  model, including steps, mins and max's for all four adjustible
	  parameters; as we feared, the treeview is now quite wide, and
	  needs scrolling. But given our limiter time, I suggest we leave
	  it like this for now.
	  
	  While at it, I also done some more changes to the treeviews
	  sources, merging the *_model_create() functions into gui_init_*()
	  functions, so don't be surprised if you get some conflicts...

	  Reading in parameters to widgets is now implemented in

	  However, the problem with the RV indep column persists. Also, the
	  combo boxes and the radio buttons are still to be processed both
	  ways.
	  
	  The "Update parameters" button in the GUI has been renamed to
	  "w->p" and another one, "p->w" has been added to call the new
	  parameters->widgets function.
	  
	  This function will also solve the default value problem: since
	  the library parameters are initialized with their default values,
	  calling this function at startup should initialize the widgets to
	  the same defaults...

	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Progress report on gui_get_values_from_widgets(): I found many
	  more errors in the function (most of them mine, I'm afraid), but
	  fixed almost all.
	  
	  First, in the GTK_IS_TREE_VIEW_COLUMN block, a "GtkTreeIter
	  *iter" was decalred, and used later without the addressof (&)
	  operator. For some reason, this caused the treeviews to become
	  unstable after gui_get_values_from_widgets, and issued a cascade
	  of GTK crtitical warnings in the terminal. Fixed by replacing the
	  declaration with "GtkTreeIter iter" and using "&iter".
	  
	  Second, the GTK_IS_SPIN_BUTTON block didn't check if the
	  widget->type was value, step, min or max, and treated only
	  GUI_WIDGET_VALUE. Fixed.
	  
	  Third, the control integer "status" wasn't initialized, causing
	  the library to print out strange error codes instead of SUCCESS.
	  Fixed.
	  
	  Then, the GUI_WIDGETs that have no associated parameter weren't
	  caught in the main switch statement. Fixed.
	  
	  In the gui_init_widgets() function, some LC related columns were
	  copy-pasted and connected to RV columns by mistake. Partially
	  fixed; there still seems to be some mixing up of columns. In
	  particular, the phoebe_rv_indep is getting set to "Primary RV". I
	  still can't locate this error, but I'm working on it.
	  
	  Some other copy-paste artifacts removed from init_treeviews
	  functions.
	  
	  The final result is the following: without any LC or RV data,
	  gui_get_values_from_widgets works fine. It still segfaults with
	  data. Possibly this is related to the column mix-up. I hope to
	  have it resolved later today, or by latest tomorrow.

	  Added a "source_string" field to the spots treeview model, and
	  dropped the cell data function that was doing the index->string
	  conversion until now. I did this only for the sake of consistency
	  with other treeviews, there is no new functionality.

	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  Resolved issue that caused a segfault when new LC/RV was added
	  without defined columns. Now there are default values for all
	  three columns in LC and RV dialog.
	  
	  Each new entry (row) in the LC/RV tree view now gets selected
	  when it is added. This helps preventing segfaults that would
	  happen if edit button was pressed but none of the entries were
	  selected.
	  
	  Added (again) a new filed in the LC tree view model for the
	  filter numbers. I don't see any other simple way for referencing
	  filters.

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,

	  Filter combo boxes in LC and RV dialogs now work and filter
	  entries in LC/RV tree views are editable. There is still some
	  work to do, though. When edit button is pressed on the selected
	  LC/RV tree view entry, the filter combo box doesn't show
	  previously selected filter.

	  Computed parameters (passband luminosities, masses, radii,

	  brightnesses) added to the library and the scripter. The
	  following parameters have been declared:
	  
	  phoebe_mass1 phoebe_mass2 phoebe_radius1 phoebe_radius2
	  phoebe_logg1 phoebe_logg2 phoebe_mbol1 phoebe_mbol2 phoebe_sbr1
	  phoebe_sbr2
	  
	  These are all of KIND_COMPUTED parameter kind that is added to
	  the enum. Their values are set by call_wd_to_get_* functions.
	  They should be considered read-only, although fool-proofing
	  hasn't been done yet. To get their values, use them as any other
	  parameter, thus something like:
	  
	  double value;
	  
	  phoebe_parameter_get_value ( phoebe_parameter_lookup
	  ("phoebe_mass1"), &value);

	* phoebe-lib/configure, phoebe-lib/configure.ac:
	  
	  Another tiny change introduced to configure.ac that greatly
	  improves the experience using ./configure. If the name of the
	  flex executable is different than flex (i.e. flex-new under
	  SciLinux), it's as easy as issuing:
	  
	  ./configure LEX=flex-new
	  
	  That's all there is! :)

2007-08-22 01:49  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/configure, phoebe-lib/configure.ac:
	  
	  Flex options used for constraints are not lex-compatible. That is
	  why we explicitly require flex 2.5.33 or later during configure
	  stage for the SVN version. The distribution tarball should not
	  depend on flex or bison or gtk-doc; that should still be fixed.

	  Text view in the Load LC dialog now displays the contents of the

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c:
	  
	  Exception handler in phoebe_error () improved to print out the
	  error code that caused the exception handler to be invoked.
	  
	  The function phoebe_parameter_get_value () was using array
	  instead of vector dimension to verify the index validity; fixed.

2007-08-20 13:39  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Another couple of problems resolved: the first one was the
	  occurence char *value in gtk_tree_model_get, which should have
	  been char **value. The second was unreffing the model and the
	  column which are merely pointers to the widgets that should not
	  be unreffed before phoebe_gui_quit (). The function works, but
	  still has some issues to be worked out (see the debugging
	  output):
	  
	  1) passband names in the treeview column do not match those in
	  the lib; 2) fall-through handlers are not in place for widgets
	  that are not linked to parameters, i.e. phoebe_sidesheet_vbox; 3)
	  some exception handlers are invoked that need to be investigated;
	  4) some types are not supported yet; 5) some null iters are
	  processed.
	  
	  The aftermath is that this function sometimes comes through and
	  sometimes it segfaults. Once these issues are all resolved, it is
	  my good faith that everything might Just Work (TM). ;)

2007-08-20 13:04  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_callbacks.c:
	  
	  I added code to increase/decrease the phoebe_lcno, phoebe_rvno
	  and phoebe_spots_no1&2 to the signal handlers for add, edit and
	  remove buttons of the corresponding treeviews.

	* phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe.glade,

	  phoebe-gui/glade/phoebe_warning.glade:
	  
	  Remodeled Potential calculator window and warning window and
	  added some widgets to the main window.

2007-08-20 04:06  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Another syntax bug removed: function phoebe_parameter_set_value
	  () takes *three* arguments for arrays: the parameter, the index,
	  and the value; in the code only two arguments were passed. The
	  index is now parsed correctly, but the program still segfaults at
	  the gtk_tree_model_iter_next () call.
	  
	  The reason for failure in principle is setting passband-dependent
	  parameters before setting their dependencies properly. For
	  example, setting phoebe_lc_filter[1] will fail unless phoebe_lcno
	  had been set to (at least) 1 before. Function
	  phoebe_parameter_set_value () returns a index-out-of-range error
	  code properly, but the GUI didn't test for this; it now does that
	  as well.
	  
	  I got this far; I'll hopefully be able to continue tomorrow. If
	  anyone else has the time to look into the changes that have been
	  committed now and to pick up troubleshooting from here, that
	  would be great. O:)

	  Exception handlers added to switch statements. Sorry for some
	  indentation reorganization, I'm a creature of habit! O:)

2007-08-19 17:51  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Function gui_get_values_from_widgets () was changing the global
	  widget table GUI_wt, which invalidated any future reference to
	  that table and caused segfaults. When scanning through a hashed
	  table, a local pointer should be incremented, not the pointer to
	  the global table, otherwise the references to all traversed
	  elements are lost.
	  
	  A temporary debugging statement added; clicking on update
	  parameters still causes a segfault. I'm working on it... ;)

2007-08-16 18:55  Olivera Latković <olatkovic@aob.bg.ac.yu>

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  Rewritten the TreeViewColumn block of the
	  gui_get_value_from_widget function completly. I'm ashamed to say
	  that I forgot the golden rule and fiddled with the parameters
	  directly, rather than through library functions. I fixed it all
	  now, and as a result, this section doesn't break Phoebe any more
	  (even after the latest fixes, it stil used to segfault if any
	  curves were added). One strange problem remains: after the
	  "Update parameters" is pressed, both LC and RV treevies in the
	  Data tab start behaving strangely...
	  
	  I also made the phoebe_gui_types.c a little more tidy - aligned
	  the code a bit and moved some parts around. There are so many
	  lines of similar code there that it was barely readble. I know
	  this is silly, but please don't discard these changes if they
	  cause conflicts (and they are likely to) - they took me a
	  considerable amount of time. Thank you :)

	  The temporary "Update paramteres" button now attempts to re-fill
	  the sidesheets, showing the parameters that are marked tba. But,
	  unfortunately, it doesn't really work all the time.

	* phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.c,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h,
	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c:
	  
	  The "sidesheets" now fill up with the parameters from PHOEBE_pt
	  at startup. The upper list is empty because no parameters are
	  marked to be adjusted at that time. However, I'm afraid we won't
	  be able to test this properly before the "update parameters"
	  function(s) are up and running.

	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.c, phoebe-lib/phoebe-lib.cbp:
	  
	  Added a block to gui_get_value_from_widget to handle the
	  TreeViewColumn "widgets". To do this, I had to decorate every
	  column with a set of additional data fields, one being a pointer
	  to its parent TreeView, and the other its column number (these
	  are the changes to phoebe_gui_treeviews.c).
	  
	  To try and test this a bit, I added another toolbutton to the
	  toolbar of the main window, which calls
	  gui_get_values_from_widgets. Right now this call causes a
	  segfault; by commenting pieces of gui_get_value_from_widget I
	  found that the problem is inside the CheckButton and SpinButton
	  blocks, but I don't know what the problem is.

2007-08-04 00:22  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

2007-08-03 19:02  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  Command compute_chi () simplified with the new library wrapper
	  phoebe_curve_new_from_pars () and updated to the new name
	  phoebe_cf_compute () instead of calculate_chi2 () function.

	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
	  
	  The standard deviations of the passband (phoebe_lc_sigma) were
	  not transformed to flux when magnitude->flux conversion was done.
	  That caused wrong weights of individual passbands to be passed to
	  the cost function. This has now been fixed.
	  
	  Next, function create_lci_file () was taking a whole
	  WD_LCI_parameters structure as argument; this has been changed to
	  only a pointer to that structure.
	  
	  The function calculate_chi2 () has been renamed to
	  phoebe_cf_compute (). It now adheres to the specifications and,
	  since it computes different cost functions, not only chi2, its
	  name is more appropriate. Also, the function now takes standard
	  deviations instead of weights as argument.
	  
	  Speaking of cost functions, a new cost function has been added:
	  PHOEBE_CF_EXPECTATION_CHI2. This cost function is defined as:
	  
	  cfval = \sum_i (x_calc-x_obs)^2 / x_calc
	  
	  Continuing with phoebe_parameters: parameter phoebe_extinction
	  was not properly defined - it depends on phoebe_lcno but it was
	  set to NULL dependency. This has been fixed.
	  
	  Finally, there's a bug that prevented the library from building
	  in phoebe_curve_realloc (). My sincere apologies to all! O:-)

	  Added functionality to the filter combobox in Load LC dialog.
	  Filter name and effective wavelength now show up in the LC

	  The mistery with two columned structure of LC combobox remains.

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c:

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.h:
	  
	  Function intern_chi2_cost_function () renamed to
	  phoebe_chi2_cost_function () because some compilers can't
	  dereference a locally declared function (namely, this issue
	  arises under RedHat and SciLinux). The renamed function is now

	  Example:
	  
	  macro setp (arg1, arg2) { set_parameter_value (arg1, arg2) } setp
	  (phoebe_sma, 10)

	  Changed the signature of gui_init_filter_combobox from
	  gui_init_filter_combobox(GladeXML*) to
	  gui_init_filter_combobox(GtkWidget*) so that the combos in lc/rv
	  dialogs can be passed to the function. The filters now do show up
	  in the dialogs, but nothing more (can't be "memorized" to the
	  models yet). For some reason, the combo in the lc dialog displays
	  all the filters twice per row, while the rv dialog doesen't, I
	  have no idea why, as the code is almost the same.
	  
	  While at it, I changed the filter button in the
	  phoebe_load_rv.glade to a combobox.

	  A bug in phoebe_open_parameter_file () caused the fields that are
	  followed immediately by the '=' sign (i.e. phoebe_hjd0.VAL=1.0)
	  to be misread. Fixed.
	  
	  More work on constraining has been done: the NMS now cross-checks
	  the list of parameters marked for adjustment with the list of
	  constraints and removes all constrained parameters from the TBA
	  list. This way only unconstrained parameters get adjusted and
	  constrained parameters get updated after each iteration.
	  
	  Finally, a new PTF added for Johnson I passband; this commit
	  changes the makefile, the next commit will add the new file.

	  phoebe_msc1_switch phoebe_msc2_switch phoebe_asini_switch
	  phoebe_cindex_switch phoebe_cindex
	  
	  While at it, the GUI auto* files have been regenerated from
	  Makefile.am. whenever configure.ac or Makefile.am change,
	  autoreconf needs to be run from the top-level directory, i.e.
	  phoebe-gui. This will parse these files and create the

	  Following Andrej's advice, the conversion from combobox indices
	  to human readable strings is done trough the option menu of
	  PHOEBE_parameter in question. The items in the combos are now
	  copied from the library, but still hard-coded in the glade files.

	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_treeviews.h:
	  
	  The "edit" buttons for data->lc, data->rv and spots treeviews now
	  work. Only elementary error handling is in place, so some
	  warnings may appear when doing strange things (like adding a
	  curve with no filename).
	  
	  The other thing is more subtle, and open for discussion. So far
	  the column types for LCs and RVs and the source of the spots were
	  kept as strings in the models. However, they appear as combobox
	  widgets in the GUI, and combos reffer to their items by integer
	  indices. To get around this, I changed the models to contain
	  integers instead, and added a series of "cell data functions"
	  that render these indices as corresponding strings in the views.
	  However, this might proove to be a performance issue, as these
	  functions are called quite often by the treeviews... I haven't
	  noticed any impact on my (quite low-end) machine, but I thought
	  it was worth mentioning anyway.

	  1. Expanded the treeview model for spots, so that it now contains
	  adjustment information for all spot parameters.
	  
	  2. Turned the load-lc, load-rv and load-spots windows to
	  GtkDialogs. Now all the widgets inside these windows are declared
	  and initialized upon opening the dialog, and destroyed with the
	  dialog after it returns control to the main window. If "OK" is
	  pressed, the widgets are read out, and their values are assigned
	  to a new row of the corresponding treeview model. Parameters that
	  aren't entered trough these dialogs are still hard-coded to their
	  default values.
	  
	  3. Deleted some obsolete signals from phoebe.glade, and removed
	  the lot of signal handlers for the above-mentioned dialogs from
	  phoebe_gui_callbakcs.

	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.h,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c:
	  
	  Parameter constraining is now fully in place. A lot of back-end
	  structures have been created to handle conditional constraining
	  as effectively as possible. In particular:
	  
	  1) There is now a structure called PHOEBE_parameter_table_list
	  that contains all parameter tables defined by
	  phoebe_parameter_table_new () or phoebe_parameter_table_duplicate
	  (). This enables the undo implementation in future (in case we
	  decide to do it).
	  
	  2) PHOEBE_parameter_table has been extended to contain all
	  constraints as well (rather than having a separate global
	  PHOEBE_ct variable as was implemented originally).
	  
	  3) Linked list reversal functions have been added for AST and
	  parameter linked lists.
	  
	  4) The constraints parser was in a name conflict with the
	  scripter. That is why all constraining-related scanner and parser
	  functions have been prefixed with 'pc' (parameter constraining)
	  rather than the default 'yy'.
	  
	  5) NMS parameters that are passed to the cost function are now
	  moved to phoebe_nms sources. The internal NMS implementation has
	  replaced the GSL calls completely. That means that everything is
	  self-contained now.
	  
	  NMS is still offline, though, but if you try to call it from the
	  scripter, it will demonstrate the constraining functionality on
	  an example of two constraints: a=10/sin(i) and L1[2]=0.5*L1[1].
	  I'll slowly change all printf statements to phoebe_debug
	  statements, as my confidence that everything is working nicely
	  grows... ;)

	  sources; these header files have been added to the list of
	  ignored headers in docs/reference/Makefile.am; Makefile.in has
	  been regenerated.
	  
	  On a more important side, infrastructure for
	  PHOEBE_parameter_table structures has been set up. Since the API
	  should not change, another global variable PHOEBE_pt_list was
	  introduced that holds all defined parameter tables. The active
	  table is selected by the phoebe_parameter_table_activate ()
	  function; this sets a global pointer PHOEBE_pt to point to the
	  selected table in the pool of tables. This way all functions for
	  parameter manipulation act on the currently selected table.
	  
	  Next to the infrastructure, table duplication function
	  phoebe_parameter_table_duplicate () has been written; it has to
	  be performed in two stages: the first stage copies the contents
	  of parameters, and the second stage copies the dependencies. The
	  traversal needs to be done in stages because all parameters need
	  to be defined to be able to set the dependencies. The second
	  stage still needs to be done.
	  
	  The next step is to implement table duplication for the
	  minimizers.

	  Further work on constraining done; constraint evaluation is now
	  in place, rule reduction works flawlessly. A final step is to
	  figure out how to apply constraints on temporary results coming
	  from the minimizers, but I think I figured it out: each
	  invocation of the minimizer will spin off an instance of a
	  parameter table that will be used until the new parameters get
	  adopted for the main table. Hopefully I'll manage to get this
	  done by tomorrow.

	  As promised: parameter (qualifier) elements are now fully

	  "phoebe_hla[2] = 0.95 * phoebe_hla[1]"
	  
	  That also means that color constraining is now fully supported
	  without any additional programming! :) It looked hairy at start,
	  but the power of constraining will soon become very obvious!

	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_constraints.y:
	  
	  More has been done on PHOEBE constraining capabilities. Actually,
	  almost everything is in place now; new constraints are added as
	  simply as with a single call to phoebe_constraint_new (const char
	  *constraint). Here is a snippet that demonstrates this behavior:
	  
	  #include <phoebe/phoebe.h>
	  
	  int main () { phoebe_init (); phoebe_constraint_new ("phoebe_sma
	  = sin(phoebe_incl)/10.0"); phoebe_constraint_new ("phoebe_teff2 =
	  phoebe_teff1"); phoebe_quit (); return SUCCESS; }
	  
	  Memory is handled gracefully: there is a global linked list
	  PHOEBE_ct (constraints table) that is initialized and freed in
	  phoebe_init () and phoebe_quit (), respectively.
	  
	  The only thing that remains is the actual constraining, which
	  goes into the minimizers. Another parser-related unfinished
	  implementation are passband-dependent constraints, i.e. something
	  like:
	  
	  phoebe_constraint_new ("phoebe_hla[2] = 12.3 * phoebe_hla[1]")
	  
	  That will come soon, very soon. :)

	  phoebe-lib/libwd/Makefile.in, phoebe-lib/ptf/Makefile.in,
	  phoebe-lib/wd/Makefile.in:
	  
	  PHOEBE constraints are shaping up... :) The old idea with
	  hard-coded constraints such as a \sin i = const and similar is
	  now completely abandoned and has been replaced by a scary yet
	  effective parser. Yep, that means that flex and bison are now
	  required to build the library and tests have been added to
	  configure. These tests are temporary, though, because they
	  shouldn't stop the build if the parser sources are already
	  present.
	  
	  So what's the idea: the library now implements a complete
	  infrastructure for abstract syntax trees (AST). The constraint
	  has to be contained in a parsable string that consists of
	  mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, ^ are currently supported),
	  numeric values (i.e. 1, 20.3, 1.4e-2 etc), built-in functions
	  (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, ln, log, sqrt are
	  currently supported) and qualifiers (i.e. phoebe_sma, phoebe_rm
	  etc). These constraints must be expressed explicitly. For
	  example, a constraint for phoebe_sma could be:
	  
	  "10/sin(phoebe_incl*3.14/180.0)"
	  
	  This constraint would keep a*sin(i) = 10.0 whenever phoebe_incl
	  is changed.
	  
	  Back to the implementation: the lexer and the parser are in place
	  and can already parse such strings, however the connection to
	  parameters is not yet done. All build files have been updated and
	  are now generating parser source code automatically by using flex
	  and bison. For the curious, sources phoebe_constraints.c and
	  phoebe_constraints.h are most informative... ;)

	  Build files updated for full gtk-doc support, which is now fully
	  functional. A bug in gtk-doc requires that make be run twice,
	  first time to create the skeleton and the second time to create
	  the content; make will fail after the first time with no target
	  found error, but a subsequent make will successfully generate the
	  documentation. That happens only with a fresh svn checkout, all
	  subsequent make invocations are ok.
	  
	  For reference, whenever auto* tools and/or gtk-doc is upgraded,
	  the following needs to be issued in the top-level phoebe-lib
	  directory:
	  
	  gtkdocize --gtkdoc docs/reference --copy
	  
	  At the same time I bumped the version in configure.ac to 0.30RC1

	  marked for adjustment - now all marked parameters are sorted to
	  correspond to WD order. The second issue is still somewhat
	  present, namely that the default values overwrite assigned values
	  if the modifier is set after any of the fields. This has now been
	  partially fixed by saving the modifiers to the parameter file
	  first and all the remaining parameters next, but I thought of a
	  much better solution: whenever a field is encountered, look up
	  the corresponding modifier and change its value (and the
	  dimensions of all dependencies) accordingly. An extension of
	  PHOEBE_parameter structure will be needed with a pointer to the
	  modifier.

	  phoebe-gui/src/phoebe_gui_types.h:
	  
	  Two new files, phoebe_gui_treeviews.c and .h now contain the code
	  related to the treeviews. A gui_init_treeviews(GladeXML*)
	  function initializes the trees, and has to be called before
	  gui_init_widgets. I changed the gui_init_widgets function to take
	  a GladeXML* argument as well, and put some window initialization
	  dirctly into gui_init.
	  
	  The columns of the curve-lists are now attached to the lc and rv
	  parameters. Not sure though how we are going to retrieve the data
	  from the GtkTreeViewColumns...

	* phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c,
	  phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  The long work of updating everything in the scripter to the new
	  library functions has begun. The following functions have been
	  updated:
	  
	  scripter_set_parameter_value () scripter_mark_for_adjustment ()
	  scripter_set_parameter_limits () scripter_set_parameter_step ()
	  scripter_get_parameter_value () scripter_minimize_using_dc ()
	  scripter_adopt_minimizer_results ()
	  scripter_transform_flux_to_magnitude ()
	  
	  The scripter still doesn't build, though; it will take a few more
	  days...

	  Original DC functionality fully restored. Conditional constraints
	  and additional options (i.e. to compute HLAs and VGA) are still
	  under review - I'm thinking of a more general way on how to
	  implement them.

	  Initial gtk-doc support added to the library. All build files
	  have been updated, a new directory docs/reference has been
	  created. gtk-doc will not be used by default; if you want to use
	  it, pass --enable-gtk-doc switch to ./configure.
	  
	  The basic setup seems to work fine, but gtk-doc segfaults on the
	  current setup. It probably has something to do with the
	  formatting rules for the comments. Hopefully Olivera can look
	  into this. Another issue is the addition of GTK+ CFLAGS and LIBS
	  in docs/reference/Makefile.am - it is not final yet, but it seems
	  to work for now.

	  Take a deep breath before reading this... The latest commit of
	  the library is an all-scale re-implementation of PHOEBE
	  parameters. The partial commit is done so that Gal and Olivera
	  can build the widget table with the up-to-specs code instead of
	  the old obsolete constructs. Yet be sure to take extra care,
	  because numerous changes have hit the SVN and some of the
	  functions (i.e. minimizers, open/save error handling etc) are
	  known not to work. Do not update to this version if you want a
	  functional scripter! You have been warned. ;) But now that you've
	  done it anyway, please wait until tomorrow, I am working on it
	  around the clock.

	  phoebe_hist_free(), which has now been fixed. Also, function
	  phoebe_spectrum_new_from_file() has been simplified.

2007-05-24 00:51  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c,
	  phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
	  
	  Function phoebe_curve_transform () added to phoebe_types. It is
	  used to do all the transformations previously done by

2007-05-15 15:03  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  The prototype for the function phoebe_spectrum_rebin () has
	  changed, calls in the scripter updated to reflect that change.

	  I integrated phoebe_settings_window into phoebe.glade file, named
	  it's widgets and wrote some handlers. Other changes are cosmetic:
	  I renamed main.c to phoebe_gui_main.c and added a
	  phoebe_gui_main.h where global variables can be stored.

2007-05-01 20:01  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_arithmetics.c:
	  
	  Spectra arithmetics did not copy the ranges properly. Fixed.

	  The raise operator (^) function moved from phoebe_scripter_ast to
	  phoebe_arithmetics. Its kind renamed from kind_pot to kind_raise.
	  
	  Because of the upgrade to Feisty, a new autoconf (2.61) has been
	  used to recreate auto* files.

2007-04-24 01:36  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* AUTHORS:

2007-04-24 01:26  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* ChangeLog:
	  
	  ChangeLog has no place in the repository, as it is automatically

	  Configure script updated to write "none" instead of "" if no
	  plotting programs are installed. All build files have been
	  updated too. Also, the build failed if GSL wasn't installed
	  because phoebe_radiation.c didn't verify whether GSL is installed
	  and enabled. Fixed.

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_arithmetics.c:
	  
	  The bug in spectra arithmetics was present in all types of

	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_directives.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_io.c:
	  
	  Several commands have been updated to reflect the PHOEBE_spectrum
	  structure change in the library. There was also a bug in the
	  multiplication of a spectrum by a scalar (wavelengths weren't
	  copied to the new spectrum) that has been fixed.

	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
	  
	  PHOEBE_spectrum structure has been reorganized. Fields wavelength
	  and flux have been removed in favor of a single histogram field
	  and all supporting function have been updated to reflect this
	  change. Furthermore, there was a deficiency in the resampling
	  function (the assumption that the values of bins are constant is
	  not adequate for oversampling) that has been removed by doing
	  linear interpolation both in wavelength and in flux.

2007-04-10 21:37  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
	  
	  A new function phoebe_hist_correlate () added to phoebe_types.c.
	  It is still somewhat rudimentary (i.e. no error-handling yet),
	  but it has been tested and it works! :)

2007-04-10 21:35  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:

	  phoebe_spectrum_realloc ().

2007-04-10 21:22  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c:

	  Limb darkening interpolation is now fully functional. It uses the
	  recently implemented interpolation function to do the job
	  properly. The interpolation function has been extended to handle
	  vectors as well.

2007-04-10 05:09  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  Command get_ld_coefficients () was temporarily disabled because
	  of the transition to new passband designations. The conversion is
	  now complete and the command is updated and enabled again.

2007-04-09 04:30  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c:
	  
	  Command get_spectrum_from_repository () now takes 3 arguments
	  instead of 4, since vrot is no longer allowed. See the most
	  recent phoebe-lib log entry for details.

	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_types.h:
	  
	  A very, VERY important function was added to phoebe_calculations:
	  phoebe_interpolate (). This is a general N-dimensional linear
	  interpolator that does the job properly. It has been optimized
	  for speed and generality. It currently knows how to interpolate
	  scalar values and spectra, and it is trivial to extend it to any
	  other type supported by PHOEBE.
	  
	  Another important change is that querying spectra repository now
	  ignores all spectra with non-zero velocities. Why? Because it
	  just doesn't make sense to have different velocities in the
	  repository since PHOEBE can compute rotational broadening on the
	  fly.
	  
	  Finally, querying spectra from the repository used a poor
	  interpolation algorithm that has now been replaced with the new
	  spiffy one. Everything checks out. The program stopped before if
	  it encountered a non-existing spectrum in the repository, whereas
	  now it aborts and notifies the user of the problem.
	  
	  The job is not quite done yet: spectra are still identified by
	  their filenames, which is not good. This should be changed before
	  the release of 0.30.

2007-03-22 02:27  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/Makefile.am, trunk/phoebe-lib/Makefile.in,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/configure, trunk/phoebe-lib/configure.ac:
	  
	  Several updates to the build files have been done. Most notably:
	  
	  1) datadir reference was obsolete and has been changed to
	  datarootdir; 2) the library is now versioned, i.e. there is a
	  version number appended to its name. The symbolic link's name
	  remains unchanged (libphoebe), so linking to the library
	  (-lphoebe) remains the same as well. This change will enable the
	  drivers (GUI and the scripter) to enforce a version dependency.
	  3) Base install directory changed from phoebe2 to phoebe. The
	  reason is simple: both versions (0.2x and 0.30) can nicely share
	  the directory.

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_driver.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_driver.h:
	  
	  The #define statement moved from the header file to the source
	  file so that the library does not depend on phoebe_build_config.h
	  and cfortran.h explicitly.

	  The following passband transmission functions have been added to
	  ptf/:
	  
	  johnson.B johnson.V johnson.H cousins.R cousins.I
	  
	  These are all in the same format, two columns where the first one
	  is wavelength in angstroms and the second one is transmission in

	  to the data themselves: LC/RV/spectra structures, passband tables
	  etc. Currently passbands have been redesigned to read in the
	  transmission functions from the ptf/ subdirectory.

	  I/O function for PHOEBE_curve and field definitions SBR1 and SBR2
	  added to reflect the library inclusion of polar surface
	  brightness fields in the PHOEBE_curve structure. The 'print'

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_parameters.c:
	  
	  Interstellar extinction treatment in PHOEBE changed; in the old
	  version (0.2x) observational data were de-reddened according to
	  Allen's formula and the model wasn't changed in any way. Strictly
	  speaking, this constitutes data temporing and as such is not
	  desireable. To remedy this issue, a new parameter is introduced:
	  
	  phoebe_extinction
	  
	  This is a passband-dependent parameter that applies the
	  extinction to the computed flux, thus reddening synthetic data.
	  There is no assumption on the reddening law of any kind, passband
	  values are decoupled between themselves. This allows for
	  user-specified extinction laws.
	  
	  The units of phoebe_extinction parameter are magnitudes for the
	  particular passband:
	  
	  m_observed^i = m_intrinsic^i + A^i for the i-th passband
	  
	  Or, in flux units:
	  
	  j_observed^i = j_intrinsic^i * 10^(-0.4*A^i) = j_intrinsic^i *
	  exp (-0.4*ln(10)*A^i)
	  
	  This correction applies to the whole passband uniquely, so it is
	  a simplified treatment of the rigorously developed formalism for
	  the 2004 paper. Once the spectra will have entered the modeling,
	  this too will be accomodated for.
	  
	  An example of using Allen's formula to preserve agreement with
	  the old PHOEBE version:
	  
	  A^i = 0.68 * R * E(B-V) * (1000/lambda[nm] - 0.35)
	  
	  For the i-th passband with its effective wavelength lambda, given
	  in nanometers, these values of phoebe_extinction[i] will match
	  the data that has *not* been subjected to de-reddening, yet the
	  flux levels will be different.
	  
	  Formally, extinction plays the same role as passband luminosities
	  and there is a 100% correlation between them. However, this is
	  still very useful, since if there is an extinction law that
	  couples extinction coefficients between different passbands,
	  passband luminosities will then correspond to *intrinsic* (rather
	  than reddened) luminosities.

	  [Sigh] Another substantial change just hit the CVS. A new
	  read-only structure PHOEBE_curve has been introduced that
	  contains computed light curve parameters. The structure, along
	  with the necessary handlers, is defined in phoebe_types.c/.h. Its
	  fields are:
	  
	  PHOEBE_curve->type ... curve type (LC or RV) PHOEBE_curve->indep
	  ... a vector of independent data points PHOEBE_curve->dep ... a
	  vector of dependent data points PHOEBE_curve->L1 ... star 1
	  passband luminosity PHOEBE_curve->L2 ... star 2 passband
	  luminosity
	  
	  This structure will be gradually extended to encompass all other
	  parameters that are computed from the given parameter-set. These
	  are radii, masses, log g/g0's etc.
	  
	  Since this was once again a substantial re-write, many functions
	  have been modified and chances are that something got broken.
	  Please exercise caution when using it and, as always, report any
	  problems ASAP.

	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
	  
	  Another significant change has been incorporated. This time,
	  handling the results of minimization has been rewritten. The
	  scripter no longer returns just a chi2 value of the fit, but the
	  whole read-only structure. For example:
	  
	  set result = minimize_using_dc () print result
	  
	  will print out all fields of this new structure. It is a generic
	  structure that is independent of the minimizer used, e.g. all
	  minimizers return the same structure. This minimizer feedback
	  structure contains the following fields:
	  
	  algorithm .. Name of the minimization algorithm iters .. Number
	  of performed iterations cputime .. Computational time cost in
	  seconds pars .. A list of adjusted parameters initvals .. A list
	  of initial parameter values newvals .. A list of converged
	  parameter values ferrors .. A list of formal parameter errors
	  chi2s .. A list of passband chi2 values wchi2s .. A list of
	  weighted passband chi2 values cfval .. Cost function value
	  (master chi2)
	  
	  Structure fields are accessed by using the '.' operator:
	  
	  print result.algorithm print result.newvals ... [etc] ...
	  
	  Since the minimizer feedback now contains a wealth of
	  information, automatic updating of corrected values has finally
	  been abandoned. To update the values, use the function
	  adopt_minimizer_results (); see below.
	  
	  Full documentation for this new principle has been written and
	  added to the Scripter API; please refer to that document for
	  details.
	  
	  Furthermore, two new scripter commands have been added:
	  
	  set var = compute_chi2 ([curve_index])
	  
	  and
	  
	  adopt_minimizer_results (result)
	  
	  The first command computes weighted chi2 values of the whole set
	  and returns an array of these values. If an optional argument
	  curve_index is passed, then chi2 of only that passband is
	  computed.
	  
	  The second command adopts the new (corrected) results of the
	  minimizer feedback structure 'result'. This way the user may test
	  the results for convergence and decide if he wants to keep or
	  discard the new values.
	  
	  This roughly sums up a ton of work. ;) The back-end had to
	  change, since now structures need to be supported too. Both NMS
	  and DC minimizers were significantly enhanced, but there are
	  still several glitches that need to be worked out - #warning-s
	  hav been added to critical places. The API documentation has been
	  updated to properly explain all these changes.
	  
	  The new implementation has been tested for the last 3 days to a
	  reasonable extent. It should be safe to use it for regular work,
	  but some caution should still be exercised and, as usual, any
	  encountered problems reported as soon as possible. O:)

	  A heavy and substantial code beautification and up-to-specs

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c:
	  
	  There were two trivial errors in phoebe_init () code that

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_fitting.c:
	  
	  Optional GSL dependency was broken by the explicit dependence of

2006-05-30 19:05  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_accessories.c:
	  
	  I just learned that errno value is not preserved after any IO
	  call, including printf; from the documentation:
	  
	  A common mistake is to do
	  
	  if (somecall() == -1) { printf("somecall() failed\n"); if (errno
	  == ...) { ... } }
	  
	  where errno no longer needs to have the value it had upon return
	  from somecall() (i.e., it may have been changed by the printf()).
	  If the value of errno should be preserved across a library call,
	  it must be saved:
	  
	  if (somecall() == -1) { int errsv = errno; printf("somecall()
	  failed\n"); if (errsv == ...) { ... } }
	  
	  This is now fixed in phoebe_open_directory and
	  phoebe_close_directory functions.

	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_ld.c:
	  
	  The LD readout function was checking /local/ directory structure,
	  failing to open non-existent /global/ files in the DIR *
	  variable. This caused problems in LD readouts if there were
	  directories present in the ld/ directory. Since the catalogs are
	  moved to the CVS, the auxiliary CVS/ directory appears in the
	  catalogs/ld directory on systems where catalogs are checked out
	  from the CVS.
	  
	  Fixing this bug also gave the opportunity to make two fool-proof
	  functions phoebe_open_directory () and phoebe_close_directory (),
	  which are placed to phoebe_accessories.c.h. Error handling
	  functions have been updated accordingly.

2006-05-30 17:45  Andrej Prša <andrej.prsa@villanova.edu>

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_base.c:
	  
	  CTRL+C was disabled, and proper handling in the scripter (and

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c:
	  
	  Additional small fixups and enhancements regarding
	  sigma-to-weight trans- formation done. The function has been
	  pretty fairly tested and should be ok for scientific use now.
	  
	  There is a caveat that should be added to the docs: if one wants
	  all photometric and/or RV data points to be taken with equal
	  weights, one must not use standard deviations in the magnitude
	  regime, since the transformation depends on the individual flux
	  value. Thus weights must be used and set to an equal value, e.g.
	  1.0.

	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_error_handling.h:
	  
	  Transformation of the flux sigma to magnitude sigma slightly
	  improved in cases of small SNR. The functions that do the
	  transformation have been heavily commented.
	  
	  Another important fixup concerns the magnitude sigma to flux
	  weight transformation; the original w = 1/\sigma^2 scheme was
	  troublesome for small values of \sigma, because the weights were
	  overflowing the 4-char space allowed by WD. The weights are now
	  rescaled to the 0.01-10.0 interval. Higher values are
	  intentionally left empty, we use 99.0 for \sigma = 0 values.
	  
	  A smaller fixup of the same function concerns cases when \sigma's
	  that were passed were negative. This happened in several
	  occasions when users used Rucinski's 3rd RV column as standard
	  deviations. This is of course wrong to do, but PHOEBE now reports
	  this problem and aborts.
	  
	  Finally, the read_in_observational_data () function was
	  phoebe_debug()'ed.

	  set var = get_parameter_value (qualifier) set var =
	  get_parameter_value (qualifier, index)
	  
	  The first form will return an array in case the qualifier is an

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.h:
	  
	  All spectra handling functions that return a new spectrum have
	  been homogenized in their prototype; they all return int and the
	  first argument is the pointer to the pointer to the spectrum
	  which is allocated in the function itself. This makes it more
	  transparent for the driving functions since for all handlers the
	  result only needs to be freed after usage.

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/Makefile.am:
	  
	  Makefile changed so that the flexer generates the header file

	  Memory management has finally been improved. The ASTs are now
	  getting freed as soon as they are no longer needed; the strategy
	  for freeing is the following: ASTs are created by the parser and
	  evaluated once the kind_statement node is built. When this
	  evaluation is finished, the AST is no longer required and it is
	  freed. The current code was almost ready for this step, with two
	  notable exceptions: functions and macros. In their definition,
	  only AST pointers were referenced in the symbol table, whereas
	  they are now getting freed as soon as their definition (node
	  evaluation) is done. This has been fixed by implementing a new
	  AST function called scripter_ast_duplicate () that does just
	  that: duplicates an AST. A pointer to this copy is now stored in
	  a symbol table, so the original AST may well be freed.
	  
	  Everything seems to be working after these changes, but please
	  note that due to their nature (fiddling with memory) and initial
	  implementation things may go wrong. Badly wrong. ;) If there's
	  anyone on Earth reading this besides me (which I doubt), please
	  report any segfaults you might encounter.

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
	  
	  Oops, the first memory leak from the previous commit actually
	  wasn't a leak, it was supposed to be that way; the ASTs and AST
	  values are two different structures and each needs its own
	  allocation. Fixed.

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
	  
	  Two very significant memory leaks have been fixed: the AST
	  evaluation function made copies of primitive type AST arrays
	  (vectors, arrays, spectra), which only duplicated memory
	  needlessly. The second memory leak was caused by a stale original
	  AST that was copied to the newly allocated AST node in the symbol
	  table. Both have been fixed.

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:

	  1) the command convolve_spectra () renamed to multiply_spectra
	  (), according to the samewise change in the library,
	  
	  2) the kind_set_element node now handles spectral columns as
	  well, e.g.

	  now do something like the following:
	  
	  set i=1 set j=vector(5) info i info j
	  
	  The directive will list the variable type and in the latter case

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_spectra.c:
	  
	  Spectrum broadening function now correctly computes the FWHM of

	  This did not present a significant accuracy problem for
	  substantial resolution degradation, but when broadening from e.g.
	  50.000 to 40.000 it caused an overestimation of the FWHM. Fixed.

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_commands.c,

	  set_spectrum_properties (s, R, Rs),
	  
	  where 's' is the target spectrum, 'R' is the true resolving power
	  and 'Rs' is the sampling power of the spectrum;

	  Function phoebe_strdup () added that is a direct copy from GNU C
	  library. This function is provided because there are some C
	  libraries out there that do not define strdup() function and,
	  besides, this function breaks ANSI C specifications. All
	  instances of strdup () should be replaced with phoebe_strdup ()
	  as soon as possible.

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_grammar.y:
	  
	  Parser rule lit_or_id removed in favor of the more general expr.
	  The only two uses of this grammar structure were the statement
	  redirection operators, both of them already had proper error
	  handling implemented that needed no adaptation to the new grammar
	  logic. This further simplified grammar rules.

	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.h:
	  
	  A major rewrite in scripter command logic has been done. Commands
	  are now dynamically defined by calling the
	  scripter_command_register () function defined in
	  phoebe_scripter_types.c. Both lexer and parser, as well as AST
	  handler, are significantly simplified because of this rewrite. A
	  side effect is that all commands are now uniformly prototyped to
	  return scripter_ast_value. Several small memory leaks have also
	  been identified and removed.
	  
	  The bottom line is that external plugin-like codes can simply
	  register new scripter commands without having to interfere with
	  scripter grammar directly. This will be extremely useful once
	  people start writing plugins to PHOEBE.

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_allocations.c:
	  
	  Data parsing now removes the DOS newline characters (ASCII code

	  This ChangeLog part consists of two pretty large changes which
	  are completely different; the CVS server is down over the
	  weekend, unfortunately, so I couldn't have committed each change
	  separately. Here is the description:
	  
	  When defining arrays explicitly, e.g. set a = {1,2,3}, the
	  elements of the array itself were evaluated during the parse.
	  This posed no problems for arrays in the main script flow, but it
	  caused syntax errors in macro definitions where elements of the
	  defined array were variables. Consider the following example:
	  
	  macro test () { set i = 1 set a = {i, i+1, i+2} print a }
	  
	  This is a perfectly legal macro definition, yet because of
	  read-and-parse implementation the parsing of {i, i+1, i+2} caused
	  a syntax error because the set directive wasn't yet evaluated and
	  the variable i wasn't yet assigned. This is now fixed by changing
	  the evaluation to occur with the statement itself and not
	  separately.
	  
	  The second change is the total implementation of the prompt ()
	  command. This command provides input from the user.
	  
	  Synopsis:
	  
	  set answer = prompt ("Question? " [, "expected_type"])
	  
	  First argument is a string that is used as the prompt to which
	  the user has to give an answer. The answer is then parsed and
	  returned as an expression. Typically one whould use this command
	  as:
	  
	  set answer = prompt ("Is this correct [Y/n]? ")
	  
	  The second argument is optional and may be used to test the
	  answer type. The expected_type is a string that must be one of
	  the following:
	  
	  integer, boolean, double, string
	  
	  The command is completely fool-proof and will loop until the
	  answer to the prompt is acceptable by the lexer. The command will
	  interrupt on empty input or on CTRL+D.

	  Two accessory functions added:
	  
	  * bool atob (char *str) * char *phoebe_type_get_name (PHOEBE_type
	  type)
	  
	  atob () is a natural extension to C's ato* family of functions
	  that converts a string to the boolean and returns it.
	  
	  phoebe_type_get_name returns the string with the name of
	  PHOEBE_type variable.

	  Architecture for handling spectra has been implemented. It is
	  still rudimentary, but most important operations are already
	  supported. They include:
	  
	  - reading out a spectrum from a file - reading out a spectrum
	  from repository - setting a spectra repository - applying a
	  Doppler shift to a spectrum - resampling a spectrum to the given
	  wavelength interval and a given resolution - weighted sumation of
	  two spectra - convolving two spectra
	  
	  The scripter features the following new commands which are fully
	  functional:
	  
	  set_spectra_repository (dirname) set var =
	  get_spectrum_from_repository (T, log g/g0, [M/H], vrot) set var =

	  w2]) set var = convolve_spectra (spec1, spec2 [, ll, ul, R])
	  
	  Some of them still need to be polished, but the main
	  functionality is tested.

	  Architecture for catching software break interrupts (SIGINTs ==
	  CTRL+C) implemented. There is now a global variable called
	  PHOEBE_INTERRUPT that is set to FALSE by default and it is
	  changed to TRUE by the interrupt handler. All functions that are
	  susceptible to software breaks (i.e. fitting functions,
	  computation functions etc) need to test against the value of
	  PHOEBE_INTERRUPT and stop the execution if it is TRUE. The same
	  goes for all scripter loops that need to be interrupted. The
	  first function that makes use of this new architec- ture is the
	  NMS function. If the function is interrupted, the memory is
	  nicely freed, the value of chi2 is set to nan and the function
	  returns gracefully.

	* trunk/phoebe-lib/libphoebe/phoebe_calculations.c:

	* trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_ast.c:
	  
	  Hopefully this fixes the last regression that was introduced by
	  returning pointers instead of copied data by
	  scripter_ast_evaluate () function. All directives and commands
	  are supposed to free the evaluated arguments once they are done
	  using them so that memory leaks don't occur. If the variables
	  contained only pointers to the data, the pointers would have been
	  freed and the original data would be lost. Fixed.

	  A few callbacks regarding ephemeris and system parameters were
	  added. Callbacks are now arranged in order that follows PHOEBE's
	  structure. That means that menubar callbacks are in the beging of
	  file followed by toolbar, data, ephemeris and so on. Also
	  frequently used callbacks like ones setting PHOEBE's parameters
	  were put in separate category.

	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_core.c,
	  trunk/phoebe-scripter/src/phoebe_scripter_types.c:
	  
	  Symbol table handling frozen. There are two alternatives how to
	  handle identifiers: to have automatic variables and only one
	  scope per function or to have declared variables and local
	  scopes. Since I think declarations are not practical for
	  interpreted language, I decided to go with the first alternative.
	  That is why all symbol tables feature variables that preserve
	  their validity throughout the function/macro.
	  
	  There are two symbol tables that are generated on start-up: a
	  global symbol table that contains all constants (CONST_*
	  identifiers) and all macro and function names (initially empty),
	  and the main symbol table that contains all variables that are
	  declared within the main script structure (also initially empty).
	  As new macros and functions are defined, new symbol tables are
	  appended to a linked list. The lookup function first searches for
	  a symbol in the symbol table of the current macro/function and
	  then in the global symbol table. This enables macros/functions to
	  call other macros/functions and to have all constants globally
	  available. For example, the code:
	  
	  > macro func1 () { > print CONST_PI > } > > macro func2 () { >
	  func1 () > } > > func2 ()
	  
	  is perfectly ok.

	  Symbol table scoping removed completely. There seem to be two
	  alternatives for handling symbol tables: having automatic
	  variables and only a global scope or having declared variables
	  and local scopes. Since it is not really practical for the
	  interpreter to enforce variable declarations, I decided to go
	  with the former alternative.

	  All variable declarations that appeared in header files have been
	  moved to the corresponding source files. Header declarations are
	  still present, but they are now declared as extern. This was done
	  to get PHOEBE to compile under Mac OSX 10.4. Many thanks to
	  Romain Gauderon for his effort to trace and point out the cause
	  of the busted build under Mac!
